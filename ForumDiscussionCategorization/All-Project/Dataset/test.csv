Orpik's return will help, but Scudichar have to go.  I don't mind Scuderi positionally but look at Carolina's top 6 last playoffs.  I honestly think Letang should be up because he is a right hand shot and can get the puck to the net.  The Pens have a tendency to keep US born defensemen.  Nothing wrong with that but Letang was a perfect replacement for Jackman.  Jackman had an absolute rocket.  Now all of our defensemen are left-handed shots.  Not good for one timers on a PP.  Kovalchuk scores all his goals waiting on the left point for one-timers (he is a right handed shot.)  We have nobody to put over there to rifle it.  \n\n\nTo sum it up I'd say go after Glen Murray.

131,"http://www.turnkeyhedgefunds.com/about_hedge_funds.htm\n""Hedge Funds"" are often referred to as ""alternate investment vehicles"" and are tailored to the needs of sophisticated, high net worth private investors. A Hedge Fund is generally structured as a limited partnership having a general partner responsible for the investment activities and day-to-day operation of the fund, and limited partners who are the investors supplying capital but not participating in trading or operations of the fund. The limited partners have limited liability. That is, their exposure to loss is limited to their investment. The General Partner has unlimited liability and is liable for the activities of the partnership. The General Partners principals limit their liability through the use of a corporation or limited liability company as the General Partner. (Of course, the principals cannot limit their liability from the application of the anti fraud provisions of the Federal Securities Laws.) All of the investors’ capital is pooled and is utilized by the General Partner or Investment Manager to implement its trading or investment strategy."

152,"VUL is not worth it.  Life insurance is not meant to be an investment tool.  Though, often cash value is the enticing aspect in the eyes of the consumer, insurance should be bought for protection.  VUL is often outperformed by Universal Life and basic Whole Life because of the higher administration costs, lack of investment options, and bad market performance.\n\nThe admin costs for VUL are more costly because every time someone touches a piece of paper in the insurance business there's a charge associated with it (ie, paying quarterly is more costly than paying annually because of the admin costs of receiving 3 more payments).  With VUL there is much more paper being processed, and more parties involved.\n\nYou have more options for investment within IRA's, or general investment accounts, so why not purchase insurance for insurance and investments for investments.  Too often, VUL policies lapse due to underfunding caused by bad performance or an agent's inflated illustration (ie, 10-14% returns), thus leaving the individual without coverage and needing to repurchase insurance at a higher rate due to their increased age.\n\nIsn't the purpose of buying insurance to eliminate risk?  VUL just adds a new form of risk into the equation.  If the lower price is the incentive, go with UL.  If you can afford it, go with Whole life.  It is the grandfather of the life insurance business and more money comes out of pocket, but the stability, guaranteed return and peace of mind is worth it."

The Landlord-tenant statute, F.S. 83 does not provide for late fees and does not grant a ""grace period.""\n\nThe good news is that the statute is very specific on how a claim against a security deposit must be made (section 83.49(3)).  In order to impose a claim against your security deposit the landlord must send you a written claim by certified mail within 30 days of the end of the lease,  or the right to make any claim at all is forfeited.  \n\nIf the claim is property made be certified mail,  you must object within 15 days.  Then you can sue the landlord in small claims court.  The party that looses the case has to pay for both side's attorney fees.\n\nNow that your lease is up, you are a ""tenant at sufferance"" and technically liable for double rent until you sign a new lease or the landlord accepts a rental payment.\n\nSigning the new lease without a security deposit on it does not affect your rights to your old deposit.  Since you are not under a lease at the moment you may move with no penalty.  Just be sure to give the landlord your forwarding address, because if she doesn't know where you moved, she can send her claim against your deposit to your old rental unit.\n\nFeel free to contact me through my website for more information."

The first is easy, i.e. people like yourself who are readers of the comic and would go and see the movie just to see what they did with it. Second audience would be anyone who was remotely interested in Keanu Reeves, the biggest percentage being women aged between 15 and 45 therefore by not alluding to the bisexuality that is present in the comic they would not alienate this second and possibly bigger audience thus ensuring their profit margins. I know a little cynical but hey! and anyway throughout the movie Constantine doesn't seem really turned on by either male or female instead we are lead by the reactions of Rachel Weiz's character who seems more attracted to him than he is to her hence no kiss.

Unions were not meant to be and should not be permanent organizations.\n\nThe truth is that what labor unions were originally is very different from the large corporate unions of today.  When unions got started the scenario went something like this:\n\nA group of workers in a weaving factory are concerned about getting thier hair caught in the machines, which is in fact a distinct possibility.  They have mentioned this danger to thier supervisor, but nothing is done to make the workers safer.  \n\nOne day a twelve year old female worker does get her hair caught in the machines and is nearly scalped before the woman on the loom next to hers can get the machine to stop.  The supervisor orders the workers to keep working and sends for the doctor while the girl bleeds onto the floor.  The doctors do the best they can, but the girl dies.\n\nThe workers beg thier supervisor to see that changes are made, but nothing happens. The workers get together and decide to strike until the factory owner makes the machines safer thus forming a union. The strike causes production to significantly drop and the factory owner decides to fix the machines in order to save his business.  Once the machines are in working order, the women go to work and the union disbands. \n\nToday, unions are permanent, powerful, politically active, big money organizations who often act contrary to workers interests.  This is the problem."

560,"Once in a while a BIOS flash fails or, for any number of other reasons, your BIOS becomes corrupt, you will find that your system will not boot. With newer BIOS releases you may receive a screen that the AWARD BootBlock BIOS is attempting recovery and that it's searching for a diskette. For example:\n\n\nAward BootBlock BIOS v1.0\nCopyright (c) 2000, Award Software, Inc.\n\n\nBIOS ROM checksum error\n\n\nDetecting floppy drive A media\n\n\nWith older BIOS' (and at other times) your system will appear to be dead, with the exception that it attempts to boot from the diskette drive and then hang.\n\nIn the above scenarios, your BIOS is probably corrupt and the system is attempting to read the floppy. In these cases the BootBlock is attempting to recover your BIOS. The BootBlock is a portion of the BIOS which will sometimes boot when the BIOS itself has been corrupted to enable you to boot to a floppy and reflash. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nIn order to attempt the reflash, prepare a DOS boot diskette with no CONFIG.SYS (remember: if you prepare a boot diskette in Windows, CONFIG.SYS may be hidden by default, so it will be necessary to change your view settings in order to see it).\n\nDownload the latest BIOS for your board and unpack it into a work directory on another system's hard disk. You'll get as many as five files. The two you are interested in are named xxxxxx.BIN (replace xxxxxx with the name of the BIOS .BIN file that you are attempting to flash) and AWDFLASH.EXE. Copy these two files to your DOS diskette.\n\nCreate a single line AUTOEXEC.BAT on the diskette containing:\n\nAWDFLASH.EXE xxxxxx.BIN /CC /CD /CP /F /R /PY /SN\n\nNote the spaces after .EXE and .BIN and before each ""/"" in the above command.\n\nPrior to flashing with your recovery diskette, remove the power cord and open up your computer (you're going to need to crack the case after the flash anyway in order to manually clear your CMOS). Disconnect all drives, except your floppy drive.\n\nSeveral users have reported back that they were able to recover from the BootBlock when advised to disconnect everything except the floppy drive.\n\nTo flash with this diskette, place the floppy in drive A:, power up your system and (hopefully) after several minutes your system should reboot itself. When your system reboots, press DEL at the POST screen and shut your system down. Because your BIOS was corrupt, you should clear your CMOS settings manually using the following procedure:\n\nRemove the main power cord.\nRemove the motherboard battery (optional).\nMove the Clear CMOS jumper (CCMOS1 on Abit boards) from pins 1 and 2 to pins 2 and 3.\nPress your power switch several times to discharge any remaining power from the motherboard.\nWait a minute or two.\nReplace the motherboard battery (if you removed it).\nMove the Clear CMOS jumper back to pins 1 and 2.\nReconnect your drives.\nClose up the case.\nRestore the power.\nPower up and press DEL during the POST to get into the BIOS setup screens and reenter everything.\n\nIn order to properly detect your CPU and memory, remember to start your reentry of BIOS settings with the selection of Load Optimized Defaults.\n\nDon't forget to remove the diskette (or you'll likely boot to it and run the flash all over again).\n\nYou should see what's happening on the screen with new motherboards. With many older boards, you will be running ""blind"" unless you have an ISA Video Card installed in your system.\n\nIf nothing happens and your floppy doesn't start to access after a few minutes, power down and try again - sometimes it takes several attempts to force the BootBlock to start running the flash.\n\nThe AWDFLASH.EXE command modifiers used above are:\n/CC = clear CMOS data after programming.\n/CD = clear DMI data after programming.\n/CP = clear PnP (ESCD) data after programming.\n/F = use flash routines in the BIOS for programming (force flash).\n/R = reset s"

He is the reason Kobe plays the game. There are many and plenty that try to imitate him. Plus he is well known all over the world. I would even go as far as to say Elgin Baylor, but Elgin's competition during his time was not as quick or as strong as Michael's era. \n\nThe best small forward to play the game is Larry Bird. I would say Dr. J or Scottie Pippen or even George Gervin but because Larry could put his team on his back and go get it. . . .He could shoot the rock, post you up, dish the ball, drop a dime and he even had a couple of shake and bake moves in his game. That is what makes him the best.\n\nThe best power forward would be either Charles Barkeley or Karl Malone. Karl ran the floor better than Charles, plus he had an automatic 12-16 foot jump shot. But Charles could shoot from anywhere on the floor and dribble that ball up the court and put a move on you. They both could rebound the ball, well. So I think it is a tie with those two. It is just sad that neither one of them won a championship. \n\nThe best Center would have to be either Kareem or Hakeem (from the Rockets) Kareem has scored the most points in the NBA and had an unstoppable sky hook. He controlled the boards and blocked shots. Hakeem did the same thing, just he had a plethora of moves to make big men look bad down in the post. Just look at what he did to Shaq in the Finals, where he tourched Shaq for 28 pts per game. Plus he ran the floor just like Kareem. They both have championship rings, just Kareem has a couple of more. I think Kareem has a slight edge because of the most unstoppable shot ever. . . .DA' HOOK!\nGOD BLESS YOU and take care"

Essentially you want to hold the racquet as you would a frying pan, making sure you grip it at the very bottom of the grip.\n\nThe swing:\nTo start you racket head wants to be back and lower than where you want to make contact with the ball, keep your arm reasonably close to your side.\nContact with the ball is the most imporant part of the swing, the 'contact point' wants to be in front of your body, idealy at around net height, your racket heads wants to be pressing forwards and up.\nTo finnish the shot you want to keep your eyes on where you made contact with the ball, your racket head finnishes up high over your shoulder and your hips and shoulders should be 'squared' to the net.\n\nTo really learn a top spin forehand you want to get on a tennis court with someone that can either teach you, or knows how to hit one and you can watch their technique.\n\nPlayers like Rafael Nadal hit with alot of topspin so I would recommend you watch him play on TV if you have the chance, and Roger Federer is awesome and everyone can try and learn from him."

685,"Kirk Douglas (born December 9, 1916) in Amsterdam, NY. is an American actor and film producer known for voice and his recurring roles as the kinds of characters Douglas himself once described as ""sons of bitches"". He is also father to Hollywood actor and producer Michael Douglas.\n\nEarly life:\nDouglas was born Issur Danielovitch Demsky in Amsterdam, New York to Herschel Danielovitch and Bryna Sanglel, poor Belarusian Jewish parents (who came from Homel, also known as Gomel). He was on the wrestling team at St. Lawrence University. To help make his way through college, he thought getting an acting scholarship might work. His talents got him noticed at the acclaimed American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, where he soon received a scholarship, alongside classmate Betty Joan Perske (better, and soon to be, known as Lauren Bacall). He then served in the U.S. Navy from entry of the US intoWorld War II in 1941 until it ended in 1945. After the war he returned to New York City and started doing radio theater and commercials, while trying to break in on Broadway.\n\nDouglas was helped by actress Lauren Bacall in obtaining his first screen role in the Hal B. Wallis movie, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers 1946, starring Barbara Stanwyck. Hal B. Wallis was on his way to New York to look for new talent when Bacall suggested he look up her old drama school classmate, who was working in an off-Broadway play at the time.\n\nCareer:\nKirk Douglas received three Academy Award nominations for his work in Champion, The Bad and the Beautiful and Lust for Life (as Vincent Van Gogh). Douglas did not win any competitive Oscars, but received a special Oscar in 1996 for ""50 years as a moral and creative force in the motion picture community.""\n\nHe also played an important role in breaking the Hollywood blacklist by publicly opposing Stanley Kubrick's intention to take credit for the screenplay of Spartacus, which had been adapted from Howard Fast's novel by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo. Douglas had collaborated closely with Kubrick in Paths of Glory, where Douglas played one of his most memorable roles, as Colonel Dax, the commander of a French regiment during World War I ordered to make a suicidal attack.\n\nFor his contributions to the motion picture industry, Kirk Douglas has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Blvd. In 1984, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nIn October 2004, the avenue ""Kirk Douglas Way"" in Palm Springs, California was named in his honor by the Palm Springs International Film Society and International Film Festival.\n\nDouglas has been married twice, first to Diana Dill (born January 22, 1923; married November 2, 1943 - divorced in 1951), with whom he had two sons, actor Michael Douglas and producer Joel Douglas. And then to his second wife, Anne Buydens (married May 29, 1954 to the present) with whom he has two sons, producer Peter Vincent Douglas born November 23, 1955 and actor Eric Douglas (born June 1958; died July 6, 2004 of an accidental drug overdose).\n\nPopular at home and around the world, Kirk Douglas received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981, the French Legion of Honor in 1985, and the National Medal of the Arts in 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Kirk Douglas suffered a stroke, partly impairing his ability to speak."

However, both the AL and NL have to have a even number of teams for scheduling purposes.  If things were evened out and both leagues had 15 - 3 divisions of 5 - then either there would have to be an interleague game every day, instead of at certain periods of the year, or one team in each league would have to be idle for a day or more likely 3 days at a stretch - the equivalent of scheduling a series against a null team.\n\nThe only ways to fix it would be to either go back to the old divisional set up - two 8-team divisions in the NL and two 7-team divisions in the AL, or expand the AL by two teams, so that both leagues have 16, and go to four 4-team divisions."

868,"Alright, let's revise this joke so we can relieve the good old laugh:\n\nLittle April was not the best student in Sunday school. \nUsually she slept through the class. \n\nOne day the teacher called on her while she was napping, ""Tell me, April, who created the universe?"" \n\nWhen April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. ""GOD ALMIGHTY!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""Very good"" and April fell back asleep. \n\nA while later the teacher asked April, ""Who is our Lord and Saviour,"" But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 'JESUS CHRIST!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""very good,"" and April fell back to sleep. \n\nThen the teacher asked April a third question. ""What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"" And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time April jumped up and shouted, ""IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR A$$!"""

870,"The British Department for Education and Skills (DfES) recently launched a ""Music Manifesto"" campaign, with the ostensible intention of educating the next generation of British musicians. Unfortunately, they also teamed up with the music industry (EMI, and various artists) to make this popular. EMI has apparently negotiated their end well, so that children in our schools will now be indoctrinated about the illegality of downloading music.The ignorance and audacity of this got to me a little, so I wrote an open letter to the DfES about it. Unfortunately, it's pedantic, as I suppose you have to be when writing to goverment representatives. But I hope you find it useful, and perhaps feel inspired to do something similar, if or when the same thing has happened in your area."

874,"No, absoutely not. The arguement for it will be to keep the middle east stable, and if anything the past few years have shown that to be an impossible goal. The concern is that if things go down in flames over their, it will create a shambles of the US economy and lifestyle, and a major redistribution of wealth with many people loosing, both rich and poor, and a potential destabilization of our own government.\n\nI think that attitude is selling US citizens short. We will recover, just as they did during the depression. If anything we'll get to see a snapshot of the future as gas prices head towards $7/gallon. Life will go on, just differently.

875,"The joke I have with a co-worker is anything but an English major.  English majors tend to learn the rules without learning the art of the language.

Thinking is different than writing.  Writing is a creative process that comes before thought.  So, the first thing I'd do is write.  Then fit in college after that.\n\nStudy what interests you.  If you're going to be a writer, you're going to create your own income from publishing, right?  Grisham studied law with the intent to be a writer.  Others have done the same.  I'm not saying Grisham's the greatest author, but he's developed his interests.  \n\nGood writers tend to be good readers.  They have curious minds and have developed a sense of rythm in their writing.  Music, literature, liberal arts all come to mind as good seed beds for your mind.  \n\nYou might enjoy grabbing a Great Books list from somewhere (like Columbia) and reading through that.  It'll get you grounded in many classical things to write about.  \n\nAs far as publishing, that's another story.  You'd want a business background for that.  Publishing is just a business with a lot of self confidence.  They've created high beariers to entry to increase their salaries and their sales.  \n\nGood luck with all that.

908,"computers store this information in a CMOS chip that uses a small battery to retain the information when the computer is shut off. \n\nCMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) is type of chip that consumes very little power; therefore, while the computer is turned off, the battery discharges very slowly. But the battery will totally discharge if you leave your computer turned off for a year or so. Even if you turn your computer on every day, the battery is designed to last only a couple of years. Occasionally a battery will fail prematurely. \n\nToday’s plug-and-play computers can detect most of the necessary settings, but if your CMOS battery is dead, your computer will not be able to retain the date and time. The computer will also lose any custom settings, for example, the boot sequence. If you set a password in CMOS, you may be locked out of the computer. If the CMOS battery does fail, you might receive the message ""System Configuration Lost"" when you start the computer. It would be wise to record all the CMOS settings as a precaution. \n\nTo record the CMOS settings, watch for an on-screen prompt when you first start your computer. The prompt tells you to press a key, usually the Del or F2, to enter CMOS. To enter the CMOS configuration utility, you have to press the indicated key while the message is on the screen. After the CMOS configuration screen appears, follow the instructions provided to page through all the screens and record all the settings. \n\nIf your computer loses its time setting overnight, the CMOS battery may not be holding a charge. The CMOS battery is located inside the case on the motherboard. Changing the battery is usually a job for a computer technician. In fact, a layman might not even be able to find the battery. \n\nIf you want to locate the CMOS battery in your computer, be aware that a static discharge from your hands can damage components inside the case. After taking proper precautions, open the case and look on the motherboard for a battery. If you have a diagram of your motherboard, locate the battery on the diagram first. \n\nDifferent motherboards use different types of batteries. The battery may be shaped like a barrel or a coin. Some motherboards use a component that resembles a chip which contains the CMOS and the battery (made by DALLAS or Benchmarq). Batteries come in different voltages, so make sure you get an exact replacement. \n\nSometimes the battery is mounted in a holder. Sometimes it is soldered to the motherboard. De-soldering and re-soldering a battery is usually a job for a computer technician. An inexperienced solderer can cause a lot of damage. If you want to try to do it yourself, first practice on an obsolete circuit board. You may change your mind. \n\nIf the CMOS battery has failed because it’s too old, this might be an opportunity to upgrade your motherboard. When upgrading a motherboard, the most important considerations are to make sure the new motherboard is the correct form factor for your case, and that the new motherboard has the correct bus connector slots for your expansion boards."

Think of what he's done long term, playoff appearances, division titiles, Super Bowls.  The man clearly knows how to run a football team (even if that hasn't been clear this year) and is entitiled to continue coaching because of what he has done and can contiue to bring to the franchise.  He's better than anyone that would replace him anyways.  Why would anyone, especially someone as classy and loyal as Rooney, fire someone so accomplished just because of one unfortunate year?  If you want to blame someone, blame the offense and special teams for turning the ball over so much.

965,"Unless corrections are made, orbits are usually elliptical; perigee is the point on the orbit closest to the earth, and apogee is the point farthest from the earth. Besides this eccentricity an orbit of a satellite about the earth is characterized by its plane with respect to the earth. \n\nAn equitorial orbit lies in the plane of the earth's orbit. A polar orbit lies in the plane passing through both the north and south poles. A satellite's period (the time to complete one revolution around the earth) is determined by its height above the earth; the higher the satellite, the longer the period. At a height of 200 mi (320 km), the period of a circular orbit is 90 min; at 500 mi (800 km), it increases to 100 min. At a height of 22,300 mi (36,000 km), a satellite has a period of exactly 24 hr, the time it takes the earth to rotate once on its axis; such an orbit is called geosynchronous. If the orbit is also equatorial, the satellite will remain stationary over one point on the earth's surface."

978,"I don't actually know you or your circumstances so it's impossible for me to answer with anything that would likely prove helpful to you. It sounds like a lot of this is self-perception. You seem really down on yourself, and that's never good. So the first thing you need to do is stop beating yourself up. Try being your best friend and promoter, for a start, ok?\n\nAre you shy around other people? You sound like you're probably an introvert and that's A-OK. But it does make it harder to open up with people and make friends. So you'll need to work on this too. Here's a tip: Confidence is very attractive to people. I'm not talking about arrogance or being aloof. I'm talking about projecting a positive self-image, which you do as much with your body language as spoken language. Look people in the eye and don't be afraid to express yourself. \n\nThere is no easy fix to what you're describing, though my sense is that you're feeling particularly down just now. Take it one step at a time and don't trip yourself up with negative thinking, ok? There is only one you on the planet. So treat yourself with more respect and others will too. Good luck...\n\nAnd hold your head high! :)"

980,"The thing that made me stop watching the WWE was the lack of entertainment and reality it has. It is also very predictible. The matches are so fake! I know it is 'sports entertainment' and scripted and that, but seriously, TNA is scripted, but they entertain me and they are unpredictible and the matches look real. TNA contains real talent. So does the WWE but the WWE puts its real talents in the locker room and get morons like John Cena out to hold and retain the championship for the next few years. Yes i agree with 'go TNA'. What also made me quit watching was the fact that the 'creative team' were really uncreative. They keep on reminding us the story lines that happened a few years ago. They keep on repeating things over and over again with a different twist; different wrestlers. It's crazy, it really is, they are running out of ideas and they are not entertaining me, have a nice day and thanks for this question."
981,"He was a ficticious character and opinions vary as to who his true identity was - see links below for a few\n--------\nThe real Captain Starlight was a villain named Frank Pearson, who at various times used aliases including Dr. Pearson, Major Lacey and Gordon. He was born in England in 1837 and arrived in Australia in 1866. His immediate movements are unknown, however, in 1868 he surfaced in northern New South Wales in company with a Queensland bushranger named Charles Rutherford. They bailed up a party of travellers near Walgett, stealing some money and a revolver. However, the travellers were able to give a good description of the men to the police and soon a Queensland Police trooper named McManus, a New South Wales trooper named McCabe and a blacktracker were on their track.\n----------\nMention the name Harry Redford in Longreach and you're sure to be greeted with tales from local residents that have been handed down from their parents and grandparents.\n\nDuring the last 117 years, the man has become something of a local legend.\n\nAlthough writers have, to date, written about Harry Redford, recent evidence presented by Patrick McCarthy in his book 'The Man who was Starlight',has proven that Redford's name was in fact Henry Readford. But whether he be Redford or Readford, to local residents he has come to be more popularly known as 'Captain Starlight' - a ficticious name drawn from Rolfe Boldrewood's Australian classic 'Robbery Under Arms'."

994,"A daisy-wheel printer works on the same principle as a ball-head typewriter. The daisy wheel is a disk made of plastic or metal on which characters stand out in relief along the outer edge. To print a character, the printer rotates the disk until the desired letter is facing the paper. Then a hammer strikes the disk, forcing the character to hit an ink ribbon, leaving an impression of the character on the paper. You can change the daisy wheel to print different fonts. \nDaisy-wheel printers cannot print graphics, and in general they are noisy and slow, printing from 10 to about 75 characters per second. As the price of laser and ink-jet printers has declined, and the quality of dot-matrix printers has improved, daisy-wheel printers have become obsolete."

1069,"I have already answered a question similar to this one but here's my opinion once again.\n\nGenerally speaking I believe that PRIDE has the best MMA competitors in the world. The main reason for that is quite simple. They are by far the highest paying MMA organization today and all the top fighters want to work there. \n\nAnd as far as weight divisions individually are concerned situation looks more less like this:\n\nUFC heavyweights are nowhere near PRIDE level. With fighters like Fedor Emelianenko, Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira, Mirko CRO COP Filipovic, Sergei Kharitonov, Josh Barnett, Aleksander Emelianenko, Fabricio Werdum, Mark Hunt and so on PRIDE is completely dominant in this division. UFC's best Tim Sylvia and Andrei Arlovski wouldn't even make top 8 in PRIDE.\n\nPRIDE is also dominant in LHW division with Wanderlei Silva, Mauricio SHOGUN Rua, Ricardo Arona, Hidehiko Yoshida, Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, Alister Overeem all there (their only big minus was the recent loss of Quinton RAMPAGE Jackson who signed for WFA). UFC, now that Randy Couture is retired, really only has two top level fighters in that weight class - Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell. Sobral, Bonar and Griffin are good fighters but they're not on the level of PRIDE's best.\n\nMiddleweight division is at the moment about even in PRIDE and UFC but there are really only two kings in this weight class and the rest of the competition is not on their level. They are of course Rich Franklin and Dan Henderson and that would be a dream match.\n\nWelter weight division (-170 lbs) PRIDE doesn't have (well they call -185 lbs division welter) but Matt Hughes is the undisputed champion and the best fighter in the world in that class and UFC's fighters are best there, no question about that.\n\nLightweights are without doubt better in PRIDE with Takanori Gomi, Tatsuya Kawajiri, Hayato Sakurai, Joachim Hansen, Luiz Azeredo and so on all there.\n\nSo I agree with you, PRIDE is better then UFC."

It happened with Kobe, Vince Carter, Grant Hill, etc..  This last finals thats all I would hear.  Wade would be the next Michael (after the 4th game mind you).  But I do not think he will be as good as Michael.  I think they are giving Wade too much credit, he is still very young.  And he has earned this respect from refs in just 3 yrs.  And I think this whole fall 7 times get up 8 thing has gone to his head.  He falls for every little touch now.  Soon kids everywhere are going to be falling down on the court with every little touch to get a foul called.  I do not think he has been in this league long enough to be getting touch fouls called on him.  It took Jordan a hell of a lot longer, but I think that goes back to the league really hurting for another Michael Jordan.  But don't get me wrong, I think Wade is a great player.  He has a great mid-range jumpshot, is great at getting fouls called, great at the free throw line (which gets his midrange jumpshot going), and an ok driver to the basket and finisher.  But no way the next Michael Jordan."

LOL\n\nYes, this guy is turning water into hydrogen gas, the process is called electrolysis and has been around, i dont know, 40 years or so. Junior high kids know that when you add electricity to water the hydrogen comes out as a gas that can be burned as fuel. But AH HAH! There is your problem. Where does the electricity come from. Well, you can burn GASOLINE to make electricity, you can use ATOMIC means to create electricity, or you can burn a crap load of COAL to create electricity. None of them are pretty options. How much electricity does it take to turn H2O into HHO? ALOT PEOPLE!!! So guess what? By the time you load your car down with acid batteries that need electricity, which comes from gas or coal and your car still needs gas to run, guess what? You were better going to the pump in the first place and doing the environment a favor. Its not gas companies that have us in the bind we are in folks, its mother nature. There is currently no better source of fuel for vehicles than good ol gas. You have to look at the efficiency of all processes and gas is the best.

Then you can ""tip"" from one\nmachine to the other.\n\nFinally, on newer machines (well, typically ""servers""),\nit's becoming common for there to be a ""service processor""\nto provide ""LOM"" (lights out management).  If this\nis available, you telnet to the service processor (which\nhas a distinct IP address from the rest of the system)\nand it will have the capability to take over the\nconsole.\n\nNot sure if this answers your question, but it seemed\nlike it might be related to the problem you might be\ntrying to solve."

However, I would strongly recommend avoiding this as it is currently only protecting against 90% of known viruses (letting ONE IN TEN THROUGH!) as opposed to the circa 99.3% protected by other paid-for programs.  This also doesn't protect you against spyware, adware, keyloggers, rootkits, etc.\n\nMy recommendation would be Prevx1.

My response is now as it was then...\n\nThe major problem that we are facing as earthlings is our seeming inclination to NOT take responsiblity for our own actions. Because of our society's inability to do as such, we are left with one of two choices: 1) Let people do as they please and allow society to become a land of goons and selfish, self-righteous individuals who care not about their society... or 2) Control every facet of life so that people who choose not to make responsible decisions are made to pay...\n\nAgain, brother, the problem is not that people are unable to make their own decisions, it is that people don't appear to be willing to take responsiblity for those decisions, thus leading to other's distress...\n\nI believe, personally, from things that I have learned, encountered, and dealt with in this truly exciting experience that we call ""Life,"" that freedom truly is free if we all assume it. However, people are not all alike and sadly, we are left to the majority of opinion controlling our society. Because of that, there are people who are left dissatisfied. \n\nThis dissatisfaction leads to unrest. Unrest of one, leads to manipulation of more to regain a sense of control to bring about change. From there comes the usage of the most controlling item to balance the scales (in this case MONEY). Once that is achieved, anyone with this sort of controlling factor will want to bring about changes in accordance with what they (and whoever else has assisted them in this monetary augmentation) want. Then you have the ongoing condition of our country soon to follow.\n\nIf you see, the situation went from what is good for the people, to what is good for the persons... \n\nThis, I believe, may have been the thinking behind the development of religious supremacy. If we all believe in one thing and are for one cause, then it is much more likely that we will succeed and progress. If we are all fighting as individuals with unwaivering and unforgiving beliefs, then we will hardly find any success that brings about a true progression. \n\nWhat is most frightening to me, is that it isn't the single belief in a single God or entity that is the key (it may be on a personal level, but is presently impossible at this time in the world on a global scale), it is the simple belief in the human condition and the acceptance and love of all of our earthling inhabitants that will bring about this free society.\n\nThings that are loved and cared for are hardly mistreated. If nothing is mistreated, nothing is offended, and nothing is erased. This is a very simple concept. \n\nIn the end, this sort of ideology does not request conformity, it incites appreciation of all and is ultimately our true road to freedom. \n\nHope that helps..."

As files are saved, deleted, saved again, and so on, the free space on your hard drive becomes divided into little chunks.  When new files are saved into those chunks they must be divided and saved as several smaller pieces and then reassembled when accessed.  Obviously when your computer has to grab several pieces of a file from different places and reassemble it, that is slower.\n\nDefragmenting rearranges the files on your hard drive so that they are saved whole and in one place.  It also makes your free space into a single continous area.\n\nData on a CD or DVD is permanent, that is to say you cannot move or delete it.  Therefore you cannot defragment them.

1217,"What is SST PURE? \n\nSST PURE® is a patented process of shaft alignment that analyzes a golf shaft to find its most stable orientation. Using proprietary patent-pending computer software and sensitive data-acquisition sensors, the SST PURE Shaft Alignment System quickly locates the “neutral” plane in each shaft. By assembling the club with the shaft in this SST PUREd position, off-line twisting and bending during the golf swing and at impact are greatly minimized. The SST PURE system also generates a printout for each shaft, showing its structural and performance analysis. \n\nWhy do shafts need to be PUREd? \n\nLike snowflakes and fingerprints, no two golf shafts are exactly the same. Every shaft contains irregularities in straightness, roundness and stiffness that are inherent to the manufacturing process. These structural inconsistencies can negatively or positively affect a shaft’s performance depending on how the shaft is aligned in the clubhead. SST PURE locates the most stable orientation in any shaft. \n\nThe SST PURE process works on any shaft, regardless of its material; steel, graphite, even boron or thermoplastic shafts benefit from the SST PURE process. \n\nWhat are the performance benefits of the SST PURE process? \n\nThe result of the SST PURE process is that players of all skill levels hit the ball longer, straighter and more uniformly consistent than ever before. Independent testing on players of all skill level has established that SST PURE improves impact repeatability on the center of the clubface by up to 51 percent. Clubs that have been PUREd have a softer feel than randomly installed shafts, which is the current standard for club assembly."

I have said for years now (usually as a punch-line -- yet half-seriously, too) that if I ever had the financial means, I would open such a club in Las Vegas and call it Phatt Chicks. That was long before the Phatt Pharm clothing line was launched.  (I had the name first!  Dang, I should have copy-righted it or trade-marked it or whatever you do!  I could be rich!)  Oh, well.....\nLet's face it, we live in a sexually diverse culture.  Just because many men would reject such a club I don't doubt that there is a market for your ""product"".  The reason I would select Vegas for Phatt Chicks is that you would have a large cross-section of the adult population in a city that was created tfor the express purpose of providing an outlet for adults to ""let it all hang out"".  Besides that -- it's Vegas, Baby.\nGood luck on your proposed venture.  Feel free to send me my ""cut"" if you use the name I have proposed.  Thanks!"

The USA had kept out of World War 1 also until 1917 (the war started in 1914) for the same reasons. They only got involved then because of the sinking of a US ocean liner full of U.S civilians by a German submarine. \n\nIn both wars however the USA was the only power to emerge stronger economically, militarily and politically. \n\nIt is interesting to read these days however the comments by ordinary Americans again saying that the U.S should become isolationist again and leave the rest of the world to sort its own problems out.\n\nI hope that doesnt happen as the world needs a policeman, and the U.S is the only power big enough to do the job."

Once installed, reboot the system if it doesn't reboot automatically, then when you get back to windows, right click the desktop and go to properties, click the settings tab, and reset your resolution and color depth as necessary.  You can also click the advanced button and tweak your refresh rate and other video settings here.  good luck.\n\nI should add that you can also uninstall the drivers using the device manager...but the add/remove programs method will help ensure that all registry entries and whatnot are removed.

1548,"The basic difference between the mortgage as a security instrument and a Deed of Trust is that in a Deed of Trust there are three parties involved, the borrower, the lender, and a trustee, whereas in a mortgage document there are only two parties involved, the borrower and the lender. In a Deed of Trust, the borrower conveys title to a trustee who will hold title to the property for the benefit of the lender. The title remains in trust until the loan is paid. \n\nOften a title company, escrow company or bank, is listed as the trustee on the Deed of Trust. When the loan has been paid, the trustee will issue a release deed or trustee's reconveyance deed. This deed of reconveyance should be recorded at the county recorder's office, to make public notice that the loan has been paid and that the lender's interest in the property has ended. \n\nAnother difference between a mortgage and a deed of trust is the manner in which foreclosure proceedings take place. State law will determine the method of foreclosure which must be used. Generally, the rules when using a Deed of Trust allow for a faster foreclosure time than with a judicial foreclosure required with a mortgage. Under a Deed of Trust, when the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender delivers the Deed of Trust to the trustee, who then is instructed to sell the property. \n\nAfter proper notices have been posted and rules are followed, the property is sold at a trustee's sale and the loan is paid. Be careful not to confuse a deed, which conveys title and is evidence of ownership to property, with a Deed of Trust, which is a means of securing a note and providing for foreclosure proceedings."

The I-130 petition is usually filed with the local BCIS (formerly INS) office. After approval this petition is forwarded to National Visa Center in New Hempshire. NVC completes certain requirements like Affidavit of support from the petitioner.  After that the file is forwarded to the overseas U.S embassy or consulate having jusrisdiction over the place of beneficiary's place of residence.  The Embassy then calls in the beneficiary for an interview and reviews all the local documentation as well. If every thing is in order an immigrant visa is issued.\n\nA green card holder can also file an immigrant visa petititon but only for spouse, children, unmarried sons and daughter.\n\nNow there are two basic categories one is called Immediate relative category and other one is preference category.  Immediate relative categories are not governed by any quota and all the applicants filing are processed e.g. spouse, children under 21 and parents of U.S citizen. All other categories are governed by a quota set by the federal government for each country per year. For example when a green card holder files a petition for the spouse the waiting period in this category is approximately 4 years.\n\nTo obtain further information on cutoff priority dates for preference categories check the following link:\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_1770.html"

With one-fifth of the world's population, but only 7 per cent of the world's arable land, continuing strong population growth would bring about great hardships, extreme poverty and famine. \n\nThe Chinese government decided in the 1970s to control population growth.

Read the SBA Financing page to learn about criteria needed for borrowing \n\nIt is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html\n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nHere is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.\nhttp://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.BROWSE_BENEF_RPT.show\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nI suggest you read the following books to get ideas of how to finance your business:\n\nFinancing Your Small Business  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1572484500/powerhomebizguid\nSmall Business Financing: How and Where To Get It http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0808007386/powerhomebizguid\nFinancing the Small Business: A Complete Guide to Obtaining Bank Loans and All Other Types of Financing http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580626815/powerhomebizguid\nThe SBA Loan Book http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/158062202X/powerhomebizguid\nAngel Capital : How to Raise Early-Stage Private Equity Financing http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471690635/powerhomebizguid\nFinancing Your Small Business (Barron's Business Library Series) http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764124897/powerhomebizguid\n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online http://gtionline.fdncenter.org  .

Seven were president during a wartime situation, five were not.  Four of our wartime presidents were democrats and three were republicans.  A few skirmishes that ocurred, such as 'the bay of pigs', the 'Ghana rescue mission', are not identified here as wartime situations.  It is difficult to rate these men in order of effectiveness except to say that Franklin Delano Roosevelt stands out as an accomplish leader. He brought this nation out of a depression, he  was in office when social security began, and he guided this nation through WWII.  He showed courage and leadership when others cowered, and he did all this from a wheelchair."

1824,"Champions League (More prestigious)\nAli sort of had it, but it is more complicated than the top four teams from each country league qualify.  The different countries have rankings based on how good the league is.  The top 3 leagues each get four teams, the leagues ranked 4-6 have three teams, the leagues ranked 7-15 get two teams, and leagues ranked 16 and lower get one team.  So the Spanish league, ranked number one, gets four teams qualified, while the Dutch league, ranked number seven, gets two teams qualified.  But then it gets even more complicated because they don't all enter the tournament at the same time.  The champions from the top 9 ranked leagues all automatically get to the group stage (32 teams in total), along with second place teams from the top 6 ranked leagues and the Champions League returning winner.  The other 16 teams come from previous round qualifying stages.  The link provided has a good breakdown of all the stages.\n\nUEFA Cup is basically the best teams that don't make it to the Champions League.

Do not sign any lease or document that states that you're responsible for rent beyond August 15th.\n\nNow while you're talking to her on the phone and if she refuses, it's time to play hardball (do not put this in writing).Tell her because of the financial stress of finding another place till August 15th, the alternative would be for you not to pay July's rent, not to sign anything and not be flexible in showing the place. Tell her that she will need to evict you and you will fight it in court. Tell her that she might win, but it will cost her money and time and you are willing to put everything into a storage and rent a room for a month or stay at your cousin's house once you are evicted. \n\nYou're basically making her an offer that she can't refuse. Also, if you lose the eviction, your deposit will be used to pay July's rent and you just need to pay for the days up until you got evicted. \n\nI own a few rental properties in California and if I was a renter, I would approach it in that manner.\n\nGood Luck"

McClaren's term also began almost 40 years to the day that England won its only World Cup.\n\n""It will be totally different from Sven and his five years,"" said McClaren, the former Middlesbrough manager who was groomed as Eriksson's assistant. ""I'm looking forward to the big challenge.""\n\nThe 45-year-old coach signed a four-year deal in May after Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari turned down the job.\n\n""It's a new chapter in the life of the England national team,"" said Brian Barwick, the Football Association's chief executive.\n\nMcClaren was hit with an early setback in one of soccer's most taxing jobs when former England captain Alan Shearer last week rejected an offer to work with the team, choosing to concentrate on his TV job.\n\nMcClaren still hopes to land former England coach Terry Venables, who left after leading the team to the semifinals of the 1996 European Championship.\n\n""I will look to make a few changes and freshen a few things up,"" McClaren said. ""The aim is to try to bring the whole nation closer together, to bring the England team closer to the clubs and the fans.""\n\nMcClaren was asked when he would appoint a captain to replace David Beckham, who stepped down after the World Cup. Chelsea's John Terry and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard are the leading contenders.\n\n""Individuals and smaller details we'll get to later on,"" McClaren said.\n\nMcClaren's first game is an Aug. 16 exhibition against Greece at Old Trafford. England hosts Andorra on Sept. 2 and travels to Macedonia four days later in the first qualifiers for the 2008 European Championship.\n\n""It won't be difficult for Steve to impose himself,"" Terry told The Times of London from Chelsea's preseason tour in the United States. ""Every manager is different and Steve will be really different.\n\n""Sven was a little bit quiet and Steve will be in your face a bit more, which some of us like to see. We like to see that passion which he has in him and hopefully that will rub off on us.""\n\nMcClaren was a midfielder at Hull City, Derby County, Bristol City and Oxford, where he turned to coaching youth and reserve teams. He became Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United during the very successful years of 1999-01.\n\n""One thing that makes him a good coach is he's lucky,"" said Jim Smith, who recruited McClaren to coach Derby. ""But he's a very talented coach and very good at man management. He knows what the best footballers are all about and gains their respect."""

He abused his freedom of choice, allowed feelings of self-importance to develop in his heart, began to crave worship that belonged only to God, and so enticed Adam and Eve to listen to him rather than obey God. Thus by his course of action he made himself Satan, which means ""adversary"".--Jas.1:14,15"

I think the Strokes represented a true alternative to that.  Kind of like when Nirvana came and blew away the hair metal bands.  I think The Strokes did a similar thing (though by no means are they at Nirvana's level).\n\nAnyhow, I think they are stil taken seriously because their music is rock 'n' roll.  It's edgy.

My brother has done two tours in the second conflict that is occuring now.  The fact that the initial invasion of Iraq was termed ""Shock and Awe"" in no way reflects the theory of war you just presented.  One of the reasons both wars were so damned expensive was due to our determination NOT to hit civilian targets.  Overall, it would be much easier to carpet bomb a country into capitulation than to send in an invasion force.  Just as WWII Germans.  Dresden was firebombed to the ground.  We have not done even a slight portion of the damage done in previous wars.  When we target power installations in the first war, it was specifically to deny the Iraqi millitary electricity.  We don't bomb hospitals, sewage treatment centers, public water works, schools or other civilian infrastructure.  War is hell.

2059,"For the last time. Morrison is better. He can shoot, create his own shot(by moving and off the dribble). He is an excellent passer as well as a better rebounder. While Reddick maybe a pure shooter he lacks the medium game and can't beat anybody off the dribble. Against long, athletic, & lean players he struggles to get his shots a la Temple from LSU or those guys against Florida St. (his poorest performances of the year). At 6-4 he lacks the ballhandling skills to play point and can't guard. In the NBA he would see those 6-6 to 6-8 athletic 2's every night and would get murdered. His game is great for college but it does not translate to the NBA. He could be a shooter like Steve Kerr or John Paxson but that's dependent on a low post presence to draw a double teams or a dynamic point for draw and kicks. Shelden Williams should get a third of his points for creating doubles for him. Morrison is a liability on defense but he looks like a gym rat and will work to be a average one-on-one defender AKA Bird. But leadership and that assassin's approach to the game is what really seperates the two. For example, Jordan, Magic, and Bird are assassins. While competing they would smile in your face but drop a 3 with no time remaining, they willed their teammates to be better, and have rings to show for it. Guys like Ewing, Karl Malone, and Barkley could play but didn't know how to close the deal. If Morrison played with Duke, they would be playing this weekend. They said the same about Bird because he went to Indiana St. but the boy was bad. Just a thought."

Besides carrying messages, many of the Gods relied on him to help hide their own misdeeds. He was wore winged sandals for speed, and carried a caduceus (known today as a symbol of medicine). He was also involved in travel, good luck and fortune, gambling, creativity, astronomy, music, public speaking, medicine, literature and athletics.\n\nHermes also functioned as a psychopomp, leading the souls of the dead to Hades. Because as an infant, he snuck away from his mother and stole cattle from Apollo, Hermes is the patron God of thieves.\n\nHermes father was Zeus, but his mother was Maia (a Nymph). Most of Hermes' children are lesser known figures of Greek history, but he did father Pan, the wild nature. Pan's mother was either Penelope (wife of Odysseus) or Callisto (another Nymph). As with much of the lineages of Greek legend, it depends on which myths you are reading.\n\nHermes was in control of the elements, and was the patron God of alchemists. Even today, he is credited with founding the magickal practices of Hermeticism. Not a religion, this is an esoteric path that includes alchemy, Qabalah, and theosophy. He is sometimes associated with the Egyptian god of knowledge and writing, Thoth. It's believed that Hermes/Thoth created the Emerald Tablets, which form the basis of Hermetic thought.\n\nIn the Roman pantheon, Hermes was known as Mercury."

2175,"DVD (sometimes known as ""Digital Versatile Disc"" or ""Digital Video Disc"") is an optical disc storage media format that can be used for data storage, including movies with high video and sound quality. DVDs resemble compact discs as their physical dimensions are the same (12 cm (4.72 inches) or occasionally 8 cm (3.15 inches) in diameter) but they are encoded in a different format and at a much higher density.\n\nA compact disc (or CD) is an optical disc used to store digital data, originally developed for storing digital audio. It is the standard playback format for commercial audio recordings today.\n\nA standard compact disc, often known as an ""audio CD"" to differentiate it from later variants, stores audio data in a format compliant with the red book standard. An audio CD consists of several stereo tracks stored using 16-bit PCM coding at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Standard compact discs have a diameter of 120 mm, though 80 mm versions exist in circular and ""business-card"" forms. The 120 mm discs can hold 74 minutes of audio, and versions holding 80, 90 or even 99 minutes have been introduced. The 80 mm discs are used as ""CD-singles"" or novelty ""business-card CDs"". They hold about 20 minutes of audio. Compact disc technology was later adapted for use as a data storage device, known as a CD-ROM.\n\nTo simplify your answer.. \n\nCD hold a storage space of 700MB  and has standard quality\nand \nDVD hold up to 4700MB  Maximum quality on both sound and video\n\non standards"

2190,"Etymology\nThe name Bluetooth is derived from the cognomen of a 10th century king of Denmark, Harald Bluetooth. According to the inventors of the Bluetooth technology, Harald engaged in diplomacy which led warring parties to negotiate with each other, making Bluetooth a fitting name for their technology, which allows different devices to talk to each other.\n\nBluetooth is an industrial specification for wireless personal area networks (PANs), also known as IEEE 802.15.1.\nA wireless personal area network (WPAN) technology from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (www.bluetooth.com) founded in 1998 by Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba. Bluetooth is an open standard for short-range transmission of digital voice and data that supports point-to-point and multipoint applications.\n\nBluetooth is a radio standard and communications protocol primarily designed for low power consumption, with a short range (power class dependent: 1 meter, 10 meters, 100 meters) based around low-cost transceiver microchips in each device.\nBluetooth provides up to 720 Kbps data transfer within a range of 10 meters and up to 100 meters with a power boost. Unlike IrDA, which requires that devices be aimed at each other (line of sight), Bluetooth uses omnidirectional radio waves that can transmit through walls and other non-metal barriers. Bluetooth transmits in the unlicensed 2.4GHz band and uses a frequency hopping spread spectrum technique that changes its signal 1600 times per second. If there is interference from other devices, the transmission does not stop, but its speed is downgraded."

There are many insider professionals that buy houses like this for a living that are already on the inside and willing to pay near market value for the house.  So you wont really find much of a deal with reposed houses. Also many times with these repossed houses (Pending on what stage of forclosure) the previous owner might have up to a year to pay back the debt and receive back the rights to the house, this means you may not actually get to live in the property for up to a year after you close.  Besides, think of the houses that normally get repossessed... I am guessing a majority of them wont be in places you want to live.  Also when people are forced to leave a forclosed home, generally, they are pissed off the bank is taking their home from them and dont leave it in the best condition... It is often TRASHED!!! I recommend if you want to save money first shop for you loan, determine how much you want to spend, then look for your house...

2372,"Emmanuel ""Manny"" D. Pacquiao (born December 17, 1978), aka ""Pacman"" and ""The Destroyer"" is the reigning WBC International Super Featherweight Champion (2005–present), former RING People's Featherweight Champion (2003 to 2005), former IBF Super Bantamweight Champion (2001 to 2004), and former WBC Flyweight Champion (1998 to 1999). He has a record of 41 wins, 3 losses, and 2 draws, with 34 wins coming by way of knockout.\n\n[edit]\nBiography\nPacquiao was born in the province of Bukidnon in the Philippines. It is not certain whether he started selling bread called ""pan de sal"" on the streets or made it as a bread maker or a ""panadero"" who makes different kinds of breads including the ""pan de sal"". There are news items that link him to being cocky in bars, starting fights but that part of his personality may have faded as evident of his closeness to God (as a Catholic) on recent interviews as well as his religious gestures before and after a fight.\n\n[edit]\nCareer\nThe boxer, who hails from General Santos City, Philippines is also dubbed ""The Destroyer"" by his peers in the boxing world. He has ended many of his fights with his left punch.\n\nThe 27-year-old Pacquiao started his professional boxing career in 1995 at 106 pounds. He bounced in weight from 106 to 113 pounds before losing in his 12th fight against Rustico Torrecampo via third round technical knockout. Shortly after the Torrecampo fight Pacquiao settled in at 112 pounds, winning the WBC Flyweight title only to lose it in his second defense against Medgoen Singsurat by third round knockout. Theoretically speaking, Pacquiao may have lost the belt at the scales by not being able to make weight of 112 lb (51 kg).\n\nFollowing the loss to Singsurat, Pacquiao again jumped in weight, this time stopping at the Super Bantamweight division of 122 lb (55 kg) where he picked up the WBC International title, defending it five times before his next world title fight came. Pacquiao’s big break came on June 23rd, 2001, against IBF Super Bantamweight champion Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. Pacquiao stepped into the fight as a late replacement and walked out of the fight the newly crowned IBF Super Bantamweight champion. Pacquiao scored three knockdowns before the end of the fight was called in the fifth round.\n\n \nPacquiao wobbles Erik Morales.Manny went on to defend his title four times before the match that many consider to have defined his career, against his childhood boxing idol, Marco Antonio Barrera of Mexico came. Pacquiao rose from an official knockdown in the first round, and won the fight by technical knockout, when Barrera’s corner stopped the fight in the eleventh round. With this victory, the ""Pacman"" captured the WBO and Ring Magazine People's Featherweight Title, as Barrera had beaten Naseem Hamed previously for that belt. Pacquiao's performance established himself, according to many critics, fans and boxing magazines alike, as one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world, and put the Philippines on the boxing world's map again where he follows in the\nfootsteps of past Filipino boxing stars such as ""Flash Elorde"", Ben Villaflor, and\nPancho Villa, among others.\n\n \nPacquiao knocks down Erik Morales.Only six months removed from his win over Marco Antonio Barrera, Pacquiao went on to challenge another respected Mexican boxer, Juan Manuel Marquez, holder of the WBA and IBF Featherweight Title. Experts predicted that Marquez, a dangerous counter-puncher, would prevail over Pacquiao because of his apparently superior boxing skills. The fight turned out to be one of the greatest Featherweight clashes in the history of boxing. Pacquiao's handspeed and punching power was displayed early as he stormed Marquez with jabs and straight lefts that sent the Mexican Champion to the canvas three times in the first round alone. It looked as if Pacquiao was on his way to "

The other one looks over and says, ""Duh, can you see Florida?"" \n\nA blonde is jogging down the road and sees another blonde in a rowboat in the middle of a field.  The blonde on the road shakes her head and sighs.  ""It's blondes like THAT that give us SMART blondes bad names.  If I could swim,"" she said, ""I would go out and help her.""\n\nA blonde walks into a beauty shop with a pair of headphones on. She asks for a haircut. The blonde is led to a chair and asked to sit down. The woman who is about to cut the blonde's hair asks her to take the headphones off. The blonde does, and a few minutes later she passes out. The surprised shop worker picks up the headphones and hears a little voice saying, ""Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out..."". \n4,000 blondes pack the auditorium for the first annual Blondes Are Smart competition. A blonde is chosen from the audience to come on stage and answer a question to prove that blondes aren't dumb. The emcee asks ""What is 2 plus 2?"" The blonde thinks for a moment and answers ""Seven."" The emcee shakes his head and the audience begins chanting ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!"" The emcee asks again, ""What is 2 plus 2?"" The blonde concentrates for five minutes and finally answers ""Five."" The emcee shakes his head and the audience begins chanting ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!"" The emcee asks once again ""What is 2 + 2?"" The blonde screws up her face in thought, scratches her head, and finally answers ""Four?"" The audience begins chanting ""Give her another chance..."" \n\n\nTwo blondes are walking in a forest, they spot a pair of tracks. One suggests they're bear tracks, while the other says that they a fox tracks. Then they get hit by a train. \n\nQ: How do you make a blonde laugh on Monday morning? \nA: Tell her a joke on Friday night. \n\nQ: If you drop a blonde and a brunette from 100 ft, which hits the ground first? \nA: The brunette, because the blonde has to ask directions on the way down. \n\nEnjoy!"

In California, I believe it's two years. After that time, the presumed father becomes the legal father forever.

2429,"Both American football and soccer have their origins in varieties of football played in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century, and American football is directly descended from rugby football.\n\nMcGill University athletes, who had learned rugby from the local British Army garrison, introduced the sport to the U.S. with a game against Harvard University in 1874. The game quickly spread to other Ivy League colleges.\n\nEncouraged by Yale University's Walter Camp, the schools began to adopt rules that would differentiate American football from rugby in the 1880s. The scrimmage was introduced in 1880 and the system of downs in 1882.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, football had become notoriously dangerous; 18 college players died in 1905 alone. Colleges responded with a series of rule changes to open up the game, most importantly the forward pass, along with outlawing dangerous formations such as the ""flying wedge"", and introducing and requiring better equipment such as helmets.\n\nThe game had achieved its modern form by 1912, when the field was changed to its current size, the value of a touchdown increased to 6 points, and a fourth down added to each possession. Originally dominated by the Ivy League, football soon captured the interest of colleges nationwide. By 1916, when the Rose Bowl game matching eastern and western teams became an annual event, football had developed a national following second only to baseball among team sports.\n\nProfessional football developed in the mill towns of Pennsylvania and the American Midwest in the early years of the 20th century. The NFL was founded in 1920 in Canton, Ohio. Professional football remained a largely regional sport of secondary importance until after World War II. Television broadcasts greatly enhanced NFL football's national appeal, and the pro game surpassed both college football and baseball in popularity in the 1960s. The first Super Bowl—between the champions of the NFL and the rival American Football League—was played in 1967, and the two leagues merged in 1970"

If you are thinking of installing Norton I would definitely recommend you download their free trial to check it does not affect your machine in this way prior to opening your wallet.\n\nIf you would be interested in other Security products that are better than Norton, you should try either Prevx1, Kaspersky or F-Secure who all score over a 99% protection rating."

2466,"As to the Jewish question, the only serious contender that quickly comes to mind was Senator Joseph Liebermans' run for the Vice Presidency/Presidency a few years ago.  I don't know why there haven't been more contenders through the years.  I think this country would elect a Jewish President and I do not think most voters would automatically discount a Jewish contender just because of religion.\n\nOf course John F. Kennedy was our first, and so far our only, Catholic President.  His election proved that the American people would elect a Catholic President, and no doubt there will be others elected in the future.  The biggest reason that no Catholic was elected President prior to JFK was the fear that a Catholic President might be controlled by the Vatican (Pope).  The history of the Catholic Church tends to legitimize this fear to some extent.\n\nThe history of Europe in the last 1500 years is inextricably intertwined with the history of the Catholic Church.  The Vatican held a virtual stranglehold over the European continent for many centuries and was the power behind the political institutions of the day.  Much harm was done to many people for many many years in the name of religion.  Of course religious conflict still exists all over the world.\n\nTwo of the founding principles of the United States were the freedom of religion and the separation of Church and State.  These principles were the direct result of the lessons learned from the study of the history of Europe.\n\nThe Christian religion is divided into two basic camps, Catholic and Protestant.  While the Protestant religion has fragmented into many sects (Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc.), the Catholic religion has remained centralized with power residing in the Pope and the Vatican.  They still wield considerable power throughout the world and this power is still feared by many people.  \n\nAs a group, Protestants outnumber Catholics by significant numbers in the United States.  This voting block has kept the so called ""Catholic menace"" at bay for most of our history.  Only JFK's skill as a politician enabled him to overcome the obstacles presented by his religion.  I think he proved to most people that a President of the United States, who is of the Catholic faith, could lead this nation without being unduly influenced by the Pope or the political arm of the Vatican. I'm sure there will be others to come.\n\nHistory is fascinating to me because I think to know where we are going, we first must know where we have been.  I firmly believe in that the old saying, ""Those who fail to learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them"".  The study of history is, in part, a study of those mistakes.  Do you see a repetition of the past in the events taking place in the world today?\n\nInteresting questions always make a person think.  Thanks for your question.\n\nBest wishes to you and yours."

2493,"Types of virus\nFrom worms to macros, there's a whole host of viruses out there to catch...\n\nWorms\nThese viruses spread via computer networks. The ILOVEYOU virus above was a classic example of a worm. These viruses are becoming an increasing threat as a growing number of computers are permanently connected to networks. Worms can spread over corporate networks or via emails sent over the Internet.\n\nTrojans\nA Trojan virus takes its name from a story in Homer's Iliad where Greek soldiers pretended to make peace with their enemies, the Trojans. The Greeks made a grand peace-keeping gesture - the gift of a large wooden horse.\n\nWhen the Trojans hauled it inside their city gates, a small band of Greek warriors leapt out. They opened the gates and let the rest of the Greek army storm in to capture the city.\n\nA Trojan virus is one that opens your computer up to malicious intruders, allowing them to read your files.\n\nFile viruses\nA file virus is one that replaces a key system file on your computer. These viruses can reload themselves every time you start your computer up. Once they're in the memory, they can spread by writing themselves to any disk you insert into your disk drive.\n\nBoot sector viruses\nThis is an early type of computer virus that spreads by hiding itself in an invisible location on your hard drive or floppy disk. When your computer reads an infected floppy disk, the virus is copied from the disk to your computer's memory.\n\nFrom there, it writes itself to the 'boot sector' on your hard drive. The boot sector is read each time you turn your computer on. So the virus is constantly reloaded and can copy itself on to other floppy disks. These viruses are fairly rare nowadays, as they are easy to catch.\n\nMacroviruses\nA macrovirus infects word processor files, such as Microsoft Word documents. Although not as dangerous as other viruses, they can spread quickly if a Word file is sent via email. After an initial scare, Microsoft added protection into later versions of Word, so you receive a warning about infected documents.\n\nHoaxes\nThe virus hoax came about after friends sent each other emails about a new virus threat. Someone decided that they could cause just as much trouble by sending out fake warnings rather than real viruses.\n\nHoaxes may seem harmless, but they do a great deal of damage to the Internet as a whole. Not only do they slow down traffic and clog up email servers, but they also cause people to panic. Companies can spend money and time investigating what is just someone's idea of a joke.\n\nMobile phone viruses\n\nAlthough rare, mobile phones are the latest technology to be hit by virus problems. Some people have discovered that it is possible to crash certain types of mobile by sending them a coded text message.\n\n\nfollow links for more info"

Just like in catholic history people took liberal translations and ran with them but they were put down.   They caused death but their technology was limited.  Now the technology is not limited.  so put the two together.  Hijacked religion that can be interpreted as kill and the ability to get weapons to destroy the world.  Then read teh new testement with the Idea that they also believe Abraham was Muslim.  you cant deny facts no matter how hard you try.  sticking your head in the sand (metaphoric or physically) doesnt make this threat go away.  the Political correctness is trying to hide the facts but it must be rebeled.

2562,"Yes, I have heard of Goji Juice, I market it. I have checked out the website you listed and would have to agree with the fact that people who claim it will ""Cure"" cancer, aids, etc. are in direct violation of the company terms.  It is a ridiculous statement not to mention extremely detrimental to the rest of us who are marketing this product.\nBUT!  Let me add that the New Zealand News was also to blame for slandering this company.  Their claim that Goji has a high sugar content is completely unfounded!  I can back that with scientific evidence.  The lie that it is sending diabetics to emergency is also ridiculous.  You will note on your article and video on that site, that nowhere does it state that anyone in New Zealand tested it!  There is substantial proof on pubmed.org under the heading Lycium Barbarum that what they are saying is totally untrue.\nThe only claim we make is that Goji can help with diabetes. This tiny red fruit has been used in China for the treatment of diabetes for many years, and it's polysaccharides have been shown to help balance blood sugar and insulin response.  It also contains betaine, which can prevent fatty liver disease and vascular damage often seen in diabetics.  Goji also assists in weight loss by enhancing the conversion of food into energy instead of fat, and it increases exercise tolerance, stamina and endurance.  All of this is backed with medical evidence.\nOf course when someone starts making outrageous claims and the media gets a hold of it, they are able to tear it to shreds in minutes,  which is exactly what they did here.\nI did not hear of one Doctor in New Zealand who tested it and showed any scientific evidence to the contrary (where the sugar is concerned).  I spoke to Dr. Earl Mindell personally....he is the one who made this discovery, he is a Pharmacist, Master Herbalist and world renowned nutritionist who is also the author of the Vitamin Bible.  I asked him specifically about diabetes and glucose content because I have 2 diabetics in my home who I love dearly.  I would hardly give them the juice knowing there was any glucose content!  Dr. Mindell assured me there is a trace of glucose in each bottle, not enough to even give consideration to.  He also assured me that the health benefits would be apparent in approximately 3 months of taking the juice.\nI am satisfied with the evidence at Pubmed and The Chinese Oncologists reports that this product does indeed go to work on all auto-immune deficiencies and I will continue to market it based on what I have personally seen it do.  \nMaybe you should contact Freelife International and ask what their opinion is on all of this.  We do expect some negative feedback, as with any product, but I think most educated people would see that someone had made unreasonable claims and the media frenzy that follows only fans the flames.  I have many customers and that video would never be enough to change their minds on consuming this product for what it actually does.  They are satisfied with what it has done for them, including the 2 diabetics in my home who are seeing their blood sugar balanced for the first time in years, that they will continue to take it.  \nMillions of people can't be just imagining the benefits!\n\n\nDragondaddy!

2588,Under the Commercial Statutes adopted by most states (UCC) every good sold by a merchant includes an implied (not written) law of merchantability (unless validly disclaimed). This means that the car you bought should be fit for its ordinary purpose (driving on a day to day basis). This is a basis for replacement of the car in and of itself. \n\nOn top of that you have an express 3 year warranty that they must honor. If the dealer cannot fix the problem after three attempts (generally) this is the reasonable amount of attempts the dealership should have to fix the car before you force the manufacturer to honor the express warranty by replacing the car. It may take a demand letter or even a lawsuit filed by an attorney before they know you mean business about enforcing the express warranty.

At one point in time the Suns had J-Kidd, an old Kevin Johnson and a young Steve Nash stuck deep on the bench.  Then KJ retired, Nash was signed by the Mavericks in a deal thought to be way too high at the time, and Kidd went to the Nets for Starbury.  They tried Marbury for a while but the stigma of how much Kidd succeeded in Jersey led to Marbury getting traded to the Knicks and Nash coming back to the Suns as a free agent in a deal thought to be way too high at the time, detecting a pattern?"

The reason they run out of money is because they're spending the money as fast as its coming in on condos, strippers, and 26 inch rims for their Bentley's.  If more athletes were like Tom Brady, who restructured his contract trying to keep the Patriots team together, sports would be a better place.  \n\nI also feel that by paying these athletes the gross amounts that the owners do, sports are not competed at the highest possible level, except in football.

2702,"You should go see a doctor.  It could be many things, but there is a chance you have rheumatoid arthritis.  It is characterized by morning stiffnes in the joints, along with pain and inflammation.\n\nI am 23, and one year ago I started off with similar symptoms in one finger, then I started getting it in the others.  I went to the doctor, was diagnosed with RA, and started treatment.\n\nAlthough your problem may not be RA (I hope it's not... it's a serious, debilitating disease but their are some great treatments now), you should see a doctor ASAP.  Make sure you demand a blood test so they can check your inflammation levels etc.  If you do have RA, the sooner you start treatment the better.  It took me about 9 months to regain the use of my hands, and I'm lucky that I did.  It can cause permanent damage, but the newer meds can help slow down the damage.  Go ASAP, because I'm sure your hands are very valuable to you as a musician, and if there is something serious you need early treatment.\n\nAlso please visit wwww.arthritis.org for some backround on RA before your visit to the doctor so you can be more informed and ask the right questions so they can give you a proper diagnosis.\n\nIf it does turn out to be RA, push for early treatment, and visit the discussion boards at RA Connect on the arthritis.org site.  There you will find lots of people who are happy to give you support or info.\n\nPlease remember that there is no way to get a diagnosis except from your doctor, and there are many other, far less serious, things that could be causing your problem.  However, since it is similar to my situation I urge you to see a doctor in case it really is serious."

2743,"I don't think US laws favor the ""criminals"". It's just that one can never know with 100% certainty who is really guilty and who is really innocent, and that introduces a lot of human error into the process. Here are some problems with the American legal system:\n\n-Many states have different types of jail sentences, ranging from very short jail sentences for pretty serious crimes to very long sentences for relatively ""minor"" ones (such as the ""three strikes"" laws in states like Texas and California). These discrepancies mean that you might go to jail for life in Texas because you were caught a third time with a small quantity of an illicit drug but might only spend ten years for murder in one of the more liberal New England states.\n-Often, your legal counsel is nowhere near as important as jury selection. In the OJ case, for example, had the jury been majority white (as opposed to majority black) it is highly likely that OJ would have been convicted. Jury demographics matter a lot. Juries also are relatively poorly educated and have short attention spans. Studies have shown that juries are often more moved by courtroom theatrics and good-looking lawyers and defendants than they are by facts. Good-looking people tend to get more ""fair"" trials than bad looking people.  And race is also involved (white juries will be more inclined to convict a black man than a white one).\n-The Supreme Court has shifted from a more liberal stance to a more conservative one. For example, while the liberal Court of the 1960s and 1970s gave us ""Miranda"" rights, the more conservative Rehnquist Court has tended to side with police and law enforcement. Whereas a defendant might once have gotten off the hook if evidence was obtained without a warrant or if a legal ""technicality"" was breached, nowadays the courts give a lot more leeway to law enforcement (for example, police might come to a person's house with a warrant to search for illegal firearms and arrest a person on the possession of illicit drugs- even if drugs were not specified in the warrant). With the Patriot Act and now wire tapping, the Federal givernment has immensely expanded its ability to search individuals without court warrants.  It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court will weigh in on these measures and whether or not it will deem them un-Constitutional."

The king is never actually captured—the game ends as soon as the king is checkmated. A player who is checkmated loses the game.

2771,"First, the oil companies are making around 10% margins on gas.  See Exxon's income statement here: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=XOM&annual\n\nSo, if the government decided to chop off some of that last 10%, you might get back some of that.  Most people aren't going to be happy with just a few cents, though.\n\nFrom basic economics, if you impose a price ceiling, supply drops: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_ceiling\n\nFirms try to maximize their profits, so they'll be willing to produce less at a lower price.  If you lower it so that each gallon of gas is giving them negative profit (P < AVC), they'll just stop producing gas completely because it's dumb to keep on losing more and more money unless you're MSFT selling Xboxes trying to get market share.\n\nThey could also just sell it elsewhere and start exporting, where they can get a better price for it.  China and India are starting to demand more oil as their economies grow.  Or even sell the crude oil (without refining it) on the futures market and drive that down a little.\n\nEither way, the most likely scenario of a drastic price ceiling is long gas lines, similar to what happened in the 70s.  It's arguable whether this is more or less desirable than higher gas prices."

2794,"I found this on the IMDB message board about this movie.\n\n""The character of the killer was inspired by the true story of the serial killer with possibly the record amount of killings, Pedro Alonso Lopez, ""El Monstruo de los Andes"" (monster of the Andes), who raped and murdered between 310 - 500 girls between Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. \n\nLopez, a Colombian, was once captured in Peru by the cops. The natives of a town approached him when he was suspiciously talking to a young girl. He was captured and tortured by the natives for several hours, and he was about to be burned alive when a protestant missionary saved him. The cops intervened at that point and arrested him, but they did not believe the reports of the natives, and deported him to Ecuador. \n\nThe discovery of a mass grave after a flood in Ambato, Ecuador, in 1980 quickly led to his arrest. A confession was extracted out of him by making a priest pretend that he was a fellow inmate and join him in his cell. In one day of talking Lopez calmly confessed to all his murders. He later led investigators to the gravesites of several of his victims (53 just in the first gravesite). He currently serves a life sentence in Ecuador. """

But I'm also a political scientist, so I look at this a bit differently.\n\nIran's nuclear enrichment program is really a diversion. You have to understand that Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, were labeled members of an ""axis of evil."" Now, the United States invaded Iraq. And the Iranians know that the United States could overrun North Korea in about six weeks. Add to that the fact that we have troops in Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Turkey, and what do you have?\n\nA surrounded and very nervous Iran.\n\nThey see that as soon as North Korea starts tossing around nuclear weaponry as a potential, the United States quickly backed off any sort of war footing and started talking negotiation. In reality, nuclear weapons (or the perception therein) give the Iranian government a big bargaining chip.\n\nPlus, the United States is much less likely to invade Iran if they have a suspicion that the minute they step over the boarder, New York vanishes in a cloud of radioactive dust.\n\nAs for nuclear experiements, I'm assuming you mean testing a bomb. They won't, at least if they're smart. THhey'll give the impression that they have one, maybe even parade one down main street of Theran. But to test one would make it clear that they have a nuclear weapon, and that makes them a target.\n\nMy biggest fear about Iran having a weapon of mass destruction is not that the Iranian government would use it. Indeed, they have no system for delivering it, even to Israel. What the fear is for me is that they will lose the bomb - that is, some scientist who feels like the West screwed him might give one to a terrorist.\n\nIn reality, the fewer nuclear weapons on the planet, the safer we all are."

No computer security product is perfect; all products have less than 100% detection. The choice between products commercial and free products is thus not a choice between perfection and something less rather it is a choice between differing levels of imperfection.\n\n2. In absolute terms the best commercial AV products such as NOD32 do have higher detection rates than the best freeware versions. However the difference between the rates is relatively small.\n\n3. By combining two or more freeware products it is possible to get better detection rates than the best commercial AV programs used alone.\n\n4. Layering is an attractive option for improving malware detection rates and may well offer greater opportunities than concentrating on looking for a near-perfect single product.\n\nIn the next part of this series I'll look at the effect of adding even more layers of protection)"

2849,"Increasing the Minimum Wage will force employers to pay more for labor.  In response, companies find ways to reduce labor cost, usually by making more capital investment.  With new efficient machinery and equipment, companies no longer need all those employees and they start laying people off.  Unemployment rises and the economy slows down.  This has been a consistent and recuuring theme with unions and automakers.  The result is 90% of the ""minimum wage"" workers get raises and the other 10% get laid off.  Those 10% find it increasingly difficult to find work because all employers have found ways to produce more with fewer employees through automation.  The companies that are unable to automate (lack of funds or lack of technology) are forced out of business, creating even more employment.  The cycle repeats itself over time and the workforce gets smaller and smaller, gradually getting replaced with automation.  That is one of the reasons why the manufacturing employment in the United States has been dropping over the last 30 years while manufacting output has been rising over the same period.  If you are the one getting the raise, you are better off.  If you are the one getting laid off, you get hurt."

When they say they work harder than Americans, that is a racist remark. Plus, Americans worked to build and keep this land, we didn't run to another country crying with our hand held out. We have stamina and PRIDE. -Illegal immigrants abuse our govrnment assistance programs that were meant for the citizens of the USA when they fall on hard times, not illegal immigrants\n-They can't afford doctors so they glut the ER of hospitals to seek medical care -Our forefathers built this country. Some were illegal, that was then, this is now.

They want that land we whooped their butts for, they can't accept defeat. -They flew their flags in protest of the USA, the very country that has been putting food on their table -they bring in their drugs and gangs.\n-They disrespect the people of the USA and our leaders.

It's only money.\n\nHowever, in a more global aspect, I think that when a successful organization is making a profit, they have other obligations to pay attention to.  Since payroll is the highest expense in any organization, and there is a profit happening from somewhere, the obligation is to the community and those that are not as fortunate.  It doesn't matter to me how much a player makes.  If the player is good, has skill, and has alot to offer the team then so be it.

Israel has taken the good will of the American people *and* the American Government and used it to contribute to the anarchy we are seeing today. I just don't see how their behavior over the last couple of years is justified. I am in no way shape or form supportive of Hezbollah or Hamas but Israel is stirring the pot and it is the United States that is going to pay the ultimate price. As a matter of fact, we already are. \n\nI also have little to no faith in the United Nations. They have proven themselves to be spineless jerks and don't even come close to honoring the Charter set forth by the United Nations years ago. \n\nSomebody somewhere needs to tell Israel enough is enough. They have the right to exist and we will help insure that right but the Israel of today really is no better than the organizations they are fighting against. You can not achieve peace by repeatedly killing innocent civilians. I don't give a hoot if it is in self-defense or not. It is clear Israel is incapable of controlling their own military.  I am tired of it."

Communists are among the most authoritarian, as are socialists and fascists, and many of the parties based on enforcing dogma.  Typically, the left has been composed of those groups that want to redistribute income, and to do this one must be authoritarian, such as the communists, so it is not surprising that they are called leftist.  \n\nI much prefer to see freedom and liberty.

Zidane got his start in football (known as soccer in North America) at an early age, when he joined the US Saint-Henri club. \n\nHe moved on to Septemes Sports Olympiques after the coach convinced the director of the club to sign him. After leaving Septemes at the age of 14, Zidane participated in the first year junior selection for the league championship, the same year he was discovered.   \n\n\n\n\n Off to Cannes\n\nHe was called in for 3 days at the sport regional centre in Aix-en-Provence, where Jean Varraud, Cannes' recruiter, noticed the French/Algerian player. He ventured off to Cannes for what was intended to be a six-week stay, but remained even longer. Playing with professionals at the age of 16, it would only be a matter of time when he too would turn pro, and he knew he was on his way to realizing his dreams.\n\nShowing the determination of an athlete who wants to exceed expectations, Zidane had played his first game in First Division at the age of 17, and it was from then that football went from an ambition to a passion. The Cannes midfielder scored his first goal on February 8th, 1991 (he received a Clio as a promise from the Cannes President, who promised him a car when he scored his first goal as a professional), and his first season with the club was marked by a qualification for the UEFA Cup.\n\nZidane's second season with Cannes wasn't as promising, but on the non-professional front he met his future wife Veronique, a Spanish dancer. After a lukewarm 91-92 season, Zidane felt it was time for a change and switched to Bordeaux after he was asked to sign a four-year contract. Marseille also wanted Zidane, but Bordeaux proved to want him more."

3005,"Well, RAID systems are good for a few things and all have their stengths in the particular configuration. \n\n1. Redundentcy: if you want to have a relaiable hardware system to avoid data loss through hard-drive failure, use a RAID 1, 5, 1+0 (mirrored then striped) or 0+1 (striped then mirrored)\n\n2. READ / WRITE: when you stirpe a hard-drive (make two or more hard-drives join together as one) you actually double the read/write speed.. so a 15K rpm drive becomes 30k with a second hard-drive of equal speed.  Use RAID 0 for read/write spped. \n\n3. MASS STORAGE: prety much any raid other then 1 (mirrored drives) will give you more storage room.. \n\nSo now ask yourself the following questions; \nThough you are not affiliated with a studio, do you need the read/write speed for fast render farms?  Do you need expendable storage? Do you need a large storage space for your work? \n\nI would say that if you don't have a very high-volume render farm, a RAID 5 can be an all-round robust and flexible solution for you.  You will gain read/write speed with the proper RAID card, and get the best storage and redundancy for the buck!\n\n\nGood luck! \n\n- Eyal."

Significant investment in creative work for TV commercials is due to research which shows that television offers the ultimate combination of sound, vision and movement to create the next best thing to having a salesman in the living room. Many brands have utilised the medium to great effect to create advertising which resonates with the public psyche, good examples are Levi's (Launderette), Guinness (Horses) and Hamlet (The mild cigar)."

All the power hungry psychopaths that liked Hitler´s ideas of course. \n\nThere also was a secret part to the Hitler-Stalin-pact that came into place after the german invasion from the west - the red army came from the east and forced the polish government into fleeing to Rumania. Shortly after that Poland was divided between the two forces. \n\nWhat was behind it was simple - Hitler wrote in his book ""Mein Kampf"" that either Germany would be worldleaders or would not be at all.... so world domination was the foremost reason behind it. \nClever enough, german SS forces dressed up as polish freedomfighters and attacked the german radiostation in Gleiwitz near the polish border and declared war with Germany while posing as polish forces. With this one and a couple of other attacks they tried to justify attacking Poland shortly after. \n\nBTW, it is not true that Germany had no colonies, actually St. Thomas was a German colony (now US) just like Crab Island in the caribbean and Ghana used to be Groß Friedrichsburg. Those days were gone in the 1930s but yes, Germany had colonies."

People would scream and complain if the US invaded tomorrow, and the war would take even more troops away from other posts, but I really doubt it would get too much worse than it already is with Iraq. What Iran needs to start WW3 are some allies, especially if they're big, like, oh I dunno, Russia. Europe is also close enough to have a significant interest in what goes on in the region, but they're mostly interested in sorting out the messes in Africa.\n\nIf Russia or even a significant number of other Middle-Eastern or central Asian countries posted some of their military in Iran to physically protect it, they would all be drawn into an American invasion and the war would quickly spread. Also, the region is dangerous enough as is; Iran borders Pakistan, who like it's antagonistic neighbor India has nuclear weapons, and Isreal is also suspected of such. A major war enveloping the Middle East would likely touch off these sideshows too. Maybe China would take the opportunity to go for Taiwan while the US is too busy to look, and maybe North Korea will try moving south again. Who knows how far it could spread?"

3091,"I'm going to copy-and-paste my Sunni/Shiite rant from another question and then elaborate:\n\nThe split between the Shiite and the Sunni Muslims occured when Ali, leader of the Arab Empire was assasinated in 661 AD.\n\nThe Shiite believe that when Ali was killed he was the last true caliph (ruler) and everybody after him weren't true leaders because they weren't his descendants. Shiite are the majority in Iraq and Iran.\n\nThe Sunni Muslims accepted the Umayyad rule after Ali and make up thr overall majority of thr Middle East. \n\nNow they aren't fighting as much over the rightful kings, but fighting because they were brought up as rivals. Its like Yankee fans vs Red Sox fans. They are just rivals and it isn't as much about the cause of the rivalry anymore.\n\nNew Material Here:\n\nThis isn't the only clashing between Arabs; there are arabs that don't fit into either category and some who are just plain terrorists/ terrorist supporters.  \n\nWith an area so deeply divided it wouldn't work well.  They need to be governed strongly because of how tough the area is.  A democracy or republic isn't very easy to pull off in the Middle East.  It wouldn't last very long because of militant groups trying to attack any form of power.  \n\nThe only force strong enough to keep control over in the present-day Middle East is a dictator.  But that isn't a great thing to have, either.  What they really need is a strong Oligarchy.  This is my random opinion from out-of-the-blue.  \n\nWith an oligarchy they'd have a few ruling people.  This means that they'd most likely be fair because they can argue amongst themselves and as long as none plan to assasinate another, then it'd be like the Middle East version of a republic as long as they got the right to vote on some issues."

3100,"First of all, it isn't OFFENCES, it's offense. Now, I don't understand what you're asking, but here you go:\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAlthough the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the first five decades of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. Since the 1980s, more specific positions have evolved, namely point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center. On some occasions, teams will choose to use a three guard offense, replacing one of the forwards or the center with a third guard.\n\nTwo main defense concepts are used: zone defense and man-to-man defense. Zone defense involves players in defensive positions, guarding whichever opponent is in their zone. In man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards and follows a specific opponent and tries to prevent him from taking action. Variations of these two main structures are used.\n\nOffensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is a cut. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent marking a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick. The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then ""rolls"" away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is generally responsible for indicating which play will occur.\n\nDefensive and offensive structures, and positions, are more emphasised in higher levels in basketball; it is these that a coach normally requests a time-out to discuss.\n\n\nShooting\n \nPlayer releases a short jump shot, while her defender is either knocked down, or trying to ""take a charge.""Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket. While methods can vary with players and situations, the most common technique can be outlined here.\n\nThe player holds the ball to rest in the dominant hand's fingertips (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand on the side of the ball. The ball is shot by extending the shooting arm to become straight; the ball rolls off the finger tips while the wrist completes a full downward flex motion. Generally, the non-shooting arm is only used to guide the shot, not to power it.\n\nPlayers often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to deaden its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat arguable, but generally coaches will profess proper arch. Most players shoot directly into the basket, but in certain situations the shooter may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.\n\nThe two most common shots are the set shot and the jump shot. The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws. The jump shot is taken while in mid-air, near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.\n\nThe best shooters have good coordination, balance, courage and are well practiced. Realizing a shooting opportunity and using it is as important as basic technique; top players at the professional level rarely miss when given an unguarded look at the basket.\n\n\nPassing\n \nCarlos Arroyo shown here with the Utah Jazz, left, passes to a teammate.A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.\n\nOne of the most basic passes is the chest "

In a totalitarian state where elections have only one candidate, it would make very little diffence in the gov't, although you might get noticed and persecuted for not voting, as was the case in the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn very large nations, like the US, if even half the people, or even fewer, vote, it is still a large enough sample of citizens to ensure that the will of the people is heard.  Think of sampling in polling research to understand this.  If a sample is carefully randomized and stratified a very small number of ""votes"" will tell you what the majority of the people want, or are thinking.\n\nBut in a true democracy, if all, or a very large percent, of the people don't vote, then it becomes quite easy for the gov't to become totalitarian and change the nature of the entire society from democracy to some form of autocracy.  It has been said by some very wise person that, in a democracy, the people always get the gov't they deserve.  If they don't take advantage of the freedoms of a democracy, like voting, they will lose that right and most of their other rights; and that's what a non-voting society deserves."

3156,"Depends entirely on your state.\n\nFor example, Florida does not have a state income tax, so they charge heavy taxes on mortgage loans.  \n\nFees are broken down into many parts, and without listing what the fees are going to, it is not fair to make a judgment call on your fees.  If, for example, $3,000 is going to state taxes, then this loan is not very expensive at all.  If, however, $3,000 is going to the broker as ""origination"", ""points"" or the like, then it MIGHT be an expensive loan.\n\nIn Ohio, you would expect to pay about $2,300 in the basic, non-broker, related costs.  This includes title, pre-paids, taxes, and insurance escrows.  This would mean about $2,100 to the broker.\n\nIn the scheme of things, $2,100 is not a lot of money to pay a broker - depending on whether they are also getting paid on the interest rate.  Look for a little number somewhere on your ""Settlement Statement"" called ""YSP"" or ""Premium"" or Yeild Spread Premium.  The number next to this (not added in the big column) is the amount the broker is getting from the bank outside of closing for arranging this loan. \n\nIn our example, if this amount was about $1,000, I would say this broker was fairly paid.  Some might disagree with me, but about $3,300 in broker income is average for the industry.  If it is over this, you'll need to consider what you are comfortable paying.\n\nIf you are within 3 days of the loan closing, you have the right to ""rescind"" the transaction by following the directions on the rescion paperwork.  Follow them closely, as you likely have to fax the paperwork to the lender - not your broker.\n\nIf it is after 3 days, you'll be happy to know you are better informed today than you were then.  You likley will have no recourse.\n\nSee a lawyer if you feel really screwed, but don't rely on the end cost to make your decision.

The value of such an item is going to be hard to pin down but perhaps you can do an online search.\n\nStrangely, the Spacelander was designed about 1946 in aluminum but not placed into production until 1960, so if he has the original 1951 fiberglas prototype it's value is inestimable. A mint 1960 version has seen pricing in the $10,000 to $12,000 range.\n\nThe Spacelander, as you probably already know, was reproduced in the 1990s, and I think they are still available today, these can be had for less than a couple of thousand dollars.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing bicycles, even the smallest imperfection detracts from value unless the bike is hopelessly rare (the Spacelander may fall into this category). However, value is enhanced with original bills of sale and original literature and hangtags, etc.\n\nYou might want to check out http://sheldonbrown.com to see if he has any additional info on them.\n\nEDIT!

But for the question asked I'll assume they stay put.\n\nFor the 6th pick Id go with Michael Huff.  Its really a bit of a reach at this high a pick, but I believe that his versatiltiy of playing either corner or saftey in the NFL would benefit the very thin defensive backfield of the 49ers. \n\nAs for the 22nd pick, it would be ideal if either WR Santonio Holmes of The OSU or Chad Jackson from Florida were available to select one of them.  Another option ive been hearing of lately would be DE/OLB Manny Lawson, but any 49er fan knows that the offense is miles behind the defense in every aspect."

Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. \n\nThis he did. The following morning, Johnny described EVERYTHING to his mother. \n\n""Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started kissing and hugging her. I figured 'Sis must be getting sick, because her face started looking funny. \n\nHe must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just the way the doctor would. Except he's not as smart as the doctor because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. \n\nHis other hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt. \n\nAbout this time 'Sis got worse and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. \n\nFinally, I found out what was making them so sick......-a big eel ;had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. \n\nWhen Sis saw it, she got really scared-her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest one she's ever seen; I should tell her about the ones down at the lake by our house! \n\nAnyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel's head to keep it from biting again. \n\nSis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. \n\nSis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. \n\nAfter a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of its insides were hanging out. \n\nSis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. \n\nI guess eels are like cats- they have nine lives or something. This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet."

I think that the prime rate is going to go up to try to stem inflation  and that will decrease the demand on housing.  You also have the high fuel costs and people may not want to be buying new houses because of the costs of transportation.  On the other side, if the panhandle is anything like here, in Texas, there are fewer housing starts taking place here because most of the contractors are in New Orleans to help reconstruct the city there.

If this is a known issue with Acer, then they may likely repair it free even if it's out of warranty though you would have to pay shippng it there (and get insurance) to the repair center. Hopefully, it isn't he LCD that has gone bad - that can be expensive on a laptop. Also, you might look closely at the keyboard for an Fn (purple lettering maybe) key which will correspond to other purple writing above some of the function keys. There will be one that has some type of sun or light on it that will adjust brightness or dimness, you might tinker with these holding down the Fn key as you repeatedly press the corresponding key.

3296,"Primarily, #3 epitomizes the doctrine.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine states three major ideas, with one more added by President Theodore Roosevelt. First, it conveys that European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South. Second, it enforces Washington's rule of foreign policy, in which the U.S. will only be involved in European affairs if America's rights are disturbed. Third, the U.S. will consider any attempt at colonization a threat to its national security. Roosevelt added to the doctrine, and summed up his additions with the statement, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick.""\n\nThe border dispute with Venezuela would have essentially grown British holdings in South America, thus breaking the primary tenant of the doctrine >> European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South.\n\nBut more deeply seeded and self-serving plans were behind the creation of the Monroe Doctrine...\n\nThe end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 marked the breakup of the Spanish empire in the New World. Between 1815 and 1822 Jose de San Martin led Argentina to independence, while Bernardo O'Higgins in Chile and Simon Bolivar in Venezuela guided their countries out of colonialism. The new republics sought -- and expected -- recognition by the United States, and many Americans endorsed that idea.\n\nBut President James Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, were not willing to risk war for nations they did not know would survive. From their point of view, as long as the other European powers did not intervene, the government of the United States could just let Spain and her rebellious colonies fight it out.\n\nGreat Britain was torn between monarchical principle and a desire for new markets; South America as a whole constituted, at the time, a much larger market for English goods than the United States. When Russia and France proposed that England join in helping Spain regain her New World colonies, Great Britain vetoed the idea.\n\nThe United States was also negotiating with Spain to purchase the Floridas, and once that treaty was ratified, the Monroe administration began to extend recognition to the new Latin American republics -- Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico were all recognized in 1822.\n\nSo the dispute over the Venezuelan border was truthfully the best example of enforcement, as we (and the British) tacitly supported the Bolivarian movement in Venezuela. So we publicly chastised Britain t give them an image of compliance while, gaining their support of the doctrine against France, Russia and Spain... giving us and the British free reign over the commercial markets."

Illegal aliens generally do NOT want U.S. citizenship. Americans are very vain thinking that everybody in the world wants to be a U.S. citizen. Mexicans, and other nationalities want to remain citizens of their home \ncountries while obtaining the benefits offered by the United States such as employment, medical care, in-state tuition, government subsidized housing and free education for their offspring. Their main attraction is employment \nand their loyalty usually remains at home. They want benefits earned and subsidized by middle class Americans. What illegal aliens want are benefits of American residence without paying the price. \n\n#2. There are no jobs that Americans won't do. Illegal aliens are doing jobs that Americans can't take and still support their families. Illegal aliens take low wage jobs, live dozens in a single residence home, share expenses \nand send money to their home country. There are no jobs that Americans won't do for a decent wage. \n\n#3. Every person who illegally entered this nation left a home. They are NOT homeless and they are NOT Americans. Some left jobs in their home countries. They come to send money to their real home as evidenced by the more than 20 \nbillion dollars sent out of the country each year by illegal aliens. These illegal aliens knowingly and willfully entered this nation in violation of the law and therefore assumed the risk of detection and deportation. Those who brought their alien children assumed the responsibility and risk on behalf of their children. \n\n#4. Illegal aliens are NOT critical to the economy. Illegal aliens constitute less than 5% of the workforce. However, they reduce wages and benefits for lawful U.S. residents. \n\n#5. This is NOT an immigrant nation. There are 280 million native born Americans. While it is true that this nation was settled and founded by immigrants (legal immigrants), it is also true that there is not a nation on this planet that was not settled by immigrants at one time or another. \n\n#6. The United States is welcome to legal immigrants. Illegal aliens are not immigrants by definition. The U.S. accepts more lawful immigrants every year than the rest of the world combined. \n\n#7. There is no such thing as the ""Hispanic vote"". Hispanics are white, brown, black and every shade in between. Hispanics are Republicans, Democrats, Anarchists, Communists, Marxists and Independents. The so-called ""Hispanic vote"" is a myth. Pandering to illegal aliens to get the Hispanic vote is a dead end. \n\n#8. Mexico is NOT a friend of the United States. Since 1848 Mexicans have resented the United States. During World War I Mexico allowed German Spies to operate freely in Mexico to spy on the U.S. During World War II. Mexico allowed the Axis powers to spy on the U.S. from Mexico. During the Cold War Mexico allowed spies hostile to the U.S. to operate freely. The attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 was cheered and applauded all across Mexico. Today Mexican school children are taught that the U.S. stole California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. If you don't believe it, check out some Mexican textbooks written for their schoolchildren. \n\n#9. Although some illegal aliens enter this country for a better life, there are 6 billion people on this planet. At least 1 billion of those live on less than one dollar a day. If wanting a better life is a valid excuse to \nbreak the law and sneak into America, t"

These websites will help you understand how to search for a job better.\n\nMy third suggestion? Be your own business! Market your skills for hire to companies. For example, if you are a writer, you can market your writings to magazines who are always looking for contributors. The best thing to do is to take a Learning Annex class that focus on marketing and developing yourself so you can work from home as a freelancer. If you don't live close to a Learning Annex, they have online classes that you can learn from. \n\nDon't be afraid to invest in yourself...\n\n... just make sure you don't invest money in looking for a connection. That's a waste of money and time.\n\nAnother bit of advice: check with the Better Business Beauru. But keep in mind: not all businesses registers with the BBB. I work with a client who have to pay a lot of money not only to get into the BBB, but it seems they want to make money from every angle, like if you have a website, you can't say you are a member of the BBB unless you register to be an online rep... even if you are not selling online.\n\nGood luck!"

Oops I fell down the stairs, I wasnt hungry so I didnt eat for 2 weeks, its only a telephone pole it wont hurt that much. A woman will do what they can to deport a baby if they dont want it. Why not do it a healthy way without hurting other people. Also have you heard of how many children go through the foster system now? If all woman who had an abortion kept their baby than put it into foster care the foster care system would be out of control! If a woman has a baby keeps it for a while and then hands it over to social services that is just one more child in the system that will have to find a loving home. Personally I would rather have an abortion than to have a child and put a child through emotional distress.  An abortion is a short procedure that kills a fetus. Having a baby and not loving it is a life long emotional rollar coaster for a child. Which is better?"

Milan in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is regarded as one of the finest strikers of all time and scored 276 goals in a career cut short by injury, known for his strength on the ball, his tactical awareness and spectacular volleys. His grace earned him the titles ""San Marco"" and ""The Swan Of Utrecht"". Van Basten, who was named European Footballer of the Year three times (1988, '89 and '92) and FIFA World Player of the Year (1992) is currently the coach of the Dutch national team.\n\n[edit]\nPlaying career\nVan Basten played very briefly for Elinkwijk before Ajax signed him. He played his first game for Ajax in April 1982 and was proclaimed the new Johan Cruijff.\n\nIn 1987 Silvio Berlusconi brought Van Basten to Milan along with fellow countrymen Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard, joining them in 1988. In his first season Milan won their first scudetto (league championship) in eight years, but Van Basten played only eleven games and was constantly troubled by an ankle injury. Despite this, in Euro 88 Van Basten showed a dazzling run of form, including three goals against England and a spectacular volley in the final against the Soviet Union.\n\nHelped by his form in international competition, Van Basten had an excellent season in 1988-89, winning European Footballer of the Year and scoring nineteen goals in Serie A as well as helping Milan demolish Steaua Bucharest to win the European Cup. In 1989-90 he was Capocannoniere (Serie A's leading goal scorer) and Milan defended their European Cup successfully. The Dutch national side had a very poor World Cup in 1990, finally going out to West Germany in the second round.\n\nMilan's 1990-91 European season was ruined in the semi-final against Olympique Marseille and the club received a year long ban from European football. Van Basten had been banned for four matches earlier in the competition following a cynical elbowing offense. Domestically the club's season was also disappointing and Sampdoria won the scudetto. Van Basten fell out with Milan's manager Arrigo Sacchi and Berlusconi sacked Sacchi to placate him. Undistracted by European football in 1991-92 and managed by Fabio Capello, Milan did not lose a single game in the league and won the championship, Van Basten scoring 25 goals and becoming Capocannoniere again. Internationally the Dutch went out of Euro 92 to Denmark in a penalty shootout, Van Basten missing one.\n\nMilan stretched their unbeaten run into the 1992-93 season, going 58 matches in total before they lost a game. Van Basten played exceptionally well in the early part of the season and was voted European Player of the Year for a third time before his troublesome ankle injury recurred in a game against Ancona. Van Basten underwent another in a series of operations and returned to Milan for the final few domestic games before they lost the Champions League final to Marseille. The final was Van Basten's final game for Milan; despite enormous effort, he was unable to recover from his injuries.\n\n[edit]\nCoaching career\nVan Basten officially left Milan in 1995 and retired from football, stating he would never try management. However, he eventually realized that football was too important for him and successfully took a course with the Royal Netherlands Footba"

It sounds like such a simple thing, and their ads make them sound like they're really there for you when you need them.  But don't be swayed.  They charge incredibly ridiculous rates of interest, and if you're not careful, you can wind up in a vicious cycle with them.  Here's how:  you borrow $100 till next payday.  Then your paycheck arrives, but you don't have an extra $100 to pay back the loan.  They offer to roll it over for you.  Then you decide to take out another $50 just to get you by till next payday.  Now you owe $150 plus a whole ton of interest.  Oh yeah, and fees too.  \n\nSo what's a person to do if you're tight on cash?  Talk to your credit union or bank.  See about alternatives they have to payday loans.  Even opening a credit card will charge you less interest than using a payday lender.  \n\nThen, take a good hard look in the mirror and figure out how to cut expenses so you aren't strapped for cash.  Perhaps you could get a 2nd job for awhile to bring in some additional money."

Shape defines the abstract draw() method, but each derived class has to provide the implementation, which will vary for each of the above.\n\nNow the set of Shapes in a picture can be drawn with a method that looks like of like the following...\n\nPicture::draw()\n{\nfor each shape in Shape...\nshape.draw()\n}\n\nIf Picture contains all circles, then only Circle::draw() will be called.

The least complicated and most effective solution is to leverage the backup product you already have, and call the appropriate API's to back up your mail databases as part of your regular backup routines.\n\nIf you're an end user and not a tech, you won't have the access rights to run a batch file or anything else against the mail server so your only choice is to manually forward the existing emails to a personal account somewhere. That'd be each person forwarding all their own emails. You *may* be able to set up a ""rule"" to forward any new, incoming mail but you won't be able to forward the existing mail other than manually. And many mail systems block outgoing mail if it's bound for the Internet and has been automatically forwarded, for security reasons.

It was basically your typical softcore 80's hentai.\nWell, softcore in the sense that it didn't actually show penetration.\nBut it did show a girl getting ripped in half by a huge monsters um...thingie. That was freakish.  It's fun to make fun of, because it's so weird.  If you mean the remake though, I have no idear.  I've only seen the old one.  Oh also, one guy licks another guys sperm off this girls cheek.  It was gross.\n\nOh, it's basically about this kid (I forget his name) who is basically about to be transformed into some sort of demon god, or something. And a brother and sister team are sent to find him, only the sister thinks that it's someone else, and the brother is right and knows that it's the kid who the story revolves around and he has weird hair and whiskers like a cat and floats around and has a lot of internal monologing in his weird voice. And his sister has blue hair and is a big whore.\nAnd the main character has a crush on some chick. So basically throughout the movie he has little ""out bursts"" or whatever and kills people in horrible ways. And the whole time the girl is like ""I love you and I'll stay with you even though you're all freakish and whatnot"" And in the end she takes his demon seed and has a freak baby or something, that kills him and destroys the world I think or something like that. That's about all I got from the story, because it was poorly done and the 80's music was distracting.\nAlso I think the whole thing with dudes licking eachothers faces and sperm off of cheerleaders kind of creeped me out and made me not want to watch it.\nThe japanese are wacky."

If you really want to pick one, it's basically a matter of which you has more philosophies and policies you agree with.  Democrats tend to be more inclined to spend money on social services and impose taxes on the wealthier portions of society to pay for it.  Republicans tend to favor private businesses as a means of aiding the impoverished portion of society, and consequently often advocate lower taxes and reduced spending.  However, there are always exceptions, and there is a huge range of variation within the parties (people are going to object to this - lets just say it's signficant relative to the total variability and mainstream American politics).  If you identify with more one party or the other that's fine, but if not, you don't have to choose.  And whatever you do, don't vote for a bill or a candiate just because your party supports it/him/her.  Vote for it becaues you think it/he/she is a good bill/candidate.

3591,"One thing to keep in mind is that the ""mainstream media"" whether FOX, MSNBC, CNN, and the TV networks ABC, NBC, CBS, etc., are all owned by about 6 mega-corporations...\n\nand all these corporations are ""for profit"" - which means that their main goal is to keep you watching - watching and hopefully buying what they are selling via commercials. Trust me, their main goal is NOT to inform you about what you need to know WHEN you need to know it...\n\nSo my point here is that there is no real ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" media per se.  Yes, the reporters may tend to be more liberal, but the EDITING decisions are made by the ""suits"", and there are way more conservatives in control at this level.  \n\nWhat you may not realize are the ties the media has to government - and how they work hand in hand to censor the important news you really need to know.\n\nSo the short answer is:  Check out the internet but pay close attention to the source - after a while you will be able to tell when you have reached a credible source or not.  European media has some of the same problems (propagana via corporate control) but they are way ahead of the U.S. when it comes to telling more of the truth - especially about us!  \n\nAn admittedly liberal site http://www.buzzflash.com will give you links to stories all over the world.  But, while they *are* liberal, they are actually linking to the original story in whatever media it was originally reported - so you can read the original story and decide for yourself.  http://www.truthout.org is another similar type site without all the added commentary (editoralizing)...\n\nDo some searches on the web for WHO OWNS THE MEDIA and you'll see for yourself why the media censors your news.\n\nThink about this:  GE makes bombs for the military.  GE also owns NBC.  Now, if you PROFIT from making bombs, what is your motivation to tell the American public the WHOLE truth in advance of a ""war""?

The opening of China's markets and workforce is like opening Dutch dikes onto the plains below.    The shear capacity for growth was just overwhelming, you're trying to take a country from nothing under Mao to modernity.\n\nYou also have to remember that Mexico is a republic like the US, so any moves the government decides to make are going to be limited in both scope and depth.

3685,"Abortion is acceptable to most people if it happens because of:\n\nRape/Incest\nBaby will not survive after it is born\nMother's life is at risk if baby is born\n\nI do believe that abortion should be legal, with the exception of late-term (this is currently how it is now.)  I do NOT support abortion as a form of financial or birth control, as some use it for, and I would like to see children adopted instead, but I realize not everyone will be willing to do this, and may find other, less-satisfactory ways of aborting the baby.\n\nAbortions now are regulated and licensed.  If abortion were illegal, I do fear that back-alley abortions may start up again.  And if one woman is forced to do this, instead of going into a clean facility with properly-licensed people, and ends up getting a disease or dying from a improperly-performed procedure, that's one too many.\n\nTherefore I do believe that abortion be legal, safe and RARE."

3692,"because of the rules of taekwondo \n\nin taekwondo competition you are allowed only to punch the torso not to punch face, but to kick torso and face of the opponent \n\nstill , you can get point by punching the torso , but another thing ; the opponent puts a thick gear at his torso , so punching it wont get points , regarding that a point is count only when the hit make a big effect on opponent that could be seen (it move him) or heared (the sound of the hit) and that is the thierd reason , because when you punch that thick gear (called hugo) your punch wont affect him and wont make a sound , so judgs would never mark a point to you from a punch . but when you kick the torso , the leg is big and heavy , do it move the opponent and affects him hard and hugo makes big smash sound from the bare leg kick , so judgs mark a point . also leg is available to kick the face , which you can't do with your hand by the tkd rules , of course kicking the face hurts and many times gets KO \n\nso if you are a taekwondo instructor , or player , would you bother yourself by training punchs ?"

3696,"No.  Think about it for a minute, not from the view of the person killing themselves but from the view of the doctor.  Over 50% of people who see death outside of war have suicidal thoughts.  So if you put a doctor, especially an ER doctor or nurse, who see death already on a day to day basis, in the position of having to kill you or someone else, how would they feel.  The physician's job is to preserve life not end it.  If you start having physicians kill people, it will demoralize them when the one thing they stand (preserving life) is the one thing that they are stabbing in the back.  If physician assisted suicide is legalized, physicians will be influenced by the deaths that they see but also the deaths that they cause.  This will tip them over the edge towards suicide.  Eventually, doctors will be killing doctors who killed doctors who helped people kill themselves.  Had those people not gotten the doctor to help them commit suicide, said doctors would not be going to see other doctors to commit suicide in the first place.  Additionally, the suicidal tendencies typically do not emerge for up to 10-15 years.  The states like oregon that have allowed PAS will not see this result for up to 10 years from now and by the time that they see the result, it will be too late to stop it."

We didn't have a square election in 2000, nor did we have a choice in '04. The difference between the two candidates was nothing more than a coin toss. The real alternatives to them were pushed out by having more money and connections.\n\nAlso people get confused on what our country is. People automatically assume it's a democracy, when in fact it's a republic. Which is a limited democracy. Otherwise if we had a pure democracy, the majority woudl get whatever they want and the minority would be totally screwed. An analogy to that is two wolves tell a lamb whats for dinner. It doesn't and shouldn't work that way. We can barely even keep it a republic though.\nSo to ask what is western democracy, you have to see past what the talking heads preach and realize what is going on.\nYeah, we can elect people. yeah we can put in new laws..for ourselves, on our own account... Except when it gets hijacked by individuals who know how to manipulate it all. Then for the people to not have enough guts/critical thought to overturn the injustice...\nBut for us to force it on others is an antithesis of democracy in the first place.\nI don't recall the world calling a vote for candidate Mr. U.S. govt. and being nominated to decide what country should have a regime change first, especially when Mr. U.S. govt. supported that regime at one point.\n\nThe current aims of the U.S. govt. to coerce 'democracy' stands thus far:\n1) hypocritical, ours is failing\n2) illogical, forcing a democracy defeats itself\n3) moot, U.S. govt. could care less if people in other countries are actually free or not, it's about making the initiatives they create sound pleasant."

I know that the Democrats' hearts are in the right place, but their planned troop redeployment could have devastating effects on our troops. Senator George Allen (Rep. VA) made a good point today during the Senate vote on the two proposals for troop redeployment when he said it is never good strategy to tell your enemies what you are going to do. That is the whole point, to me, against giving a time line on our troops in Iraq. If we broadcast to the insurgents the day we plan to leave, they will know that the day after that,  they can begin destroying all the hard work the Coalition forces and Iraqis have accomplished since the ousting of Saddam. The troops need to stay until the Iraqi government feels secure enough in its ability to defend its own people. One good thing could come out of the recent Congreesional debates over this issue. Hopefully someone within the Iraqi government was watching the debates. Both sides of both houses of the U.S. Congress stressed the importance of the Iraqis need to defend themselves. That is the key to troop removal. The people of Iraq need to realize that they have the opportunity to create a real democracy. The different sects need to stop squabbling and join together and build a secure Iraq together. They need to make it clear to the insurgents that they want to have their country back. It is up to the Iraqis to fight back against the terrorist element that is perpetuating the stay of Coalition forces."

Such as when President Bush's grandfather supplied Hitler with at least a third of his war machine until an act of Congress (Trading With the Enemey Act) put an apparent stop to the Bush family's putrid plans for that time period. It's a paradigm issue with Republicans. Democrats tend to believe in the social contract, that we are stronger as a nation when we empower each other and conduct our government for broad social benefit rather than for individual benefit. Republicans, on the other hand, operate from a lower level of human development where individual empowerment means ""survival of the fittest"", ""a sucka's born every minute"", ""dominion over the planet means plunder rather than guardianship"", ""them first so that their ""superior"" genes survive"", genecide, rigging elections, lying and torture are ok if it means their survival"" sort of reasoning and so-called ""values"".

They do not care about their own neighbors or their own communities or people who are different than they are. They prefer to live in gated communities and build massive fences and walls. They relentlessly strive to disenfranchise as many people from the American Dream as possible. They fought against Americans who wanted slavery abolished. They fought against black Americans who wanted to vote. They fought against female Americans who wanted to vote. They fought against Americans who wanted to keep church and state separate. They fought against older and disabled Americans who wanted American public restrooms and sidewalks to accomodate wheelchairs.

3876,"Essentially, this view is based on the fact that the two States have their nominating processes (the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary) at the very beginning. Candidates want to make a good showing here in order to demonstrate that they are viable within their own party. However, I feel it's overstating the case to say they ""choose.....with limited input""  Recent campaigns have not borne that idea out. Voters in New Hampshire and Iowa do not, as a rule, represent opinions and concerns of the rest of the country.\n\nViewed as a horse race, which is how the media cover campaigns and elections, these two States do have an inordinate amount of attention paid to them, again only because they come first in the cycle-------they're the only show in town in the early stages. Most years, they're quickly forgotten once the next round of primaries come along.\n\nThinking back, the last time I remember these States  having real impact was in 1968, when Eugene McCarthy got 42% of the N.H. vote in the Democratic Primary to LBJ's 58%, but that was enough of a shocker to cause LBJ to take his hat out of the ring.\n\nThe reality is,not the early state contests but the wheeling and dealing that bring the foregone results at the National Conventions. You have to go back 46 years, to 1960, to see a Convention where the outcome was in any doubt."

3883,"The illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n""Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico’s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. \n\n \nCultural imperialism\n\n \n\nWe experience Mexico’s assault on our country incrementally—as a series of mini-crises, ea"

3888,"The United States was never willing to do what was necessary to end North Vietnamese and world communism help to the Viet Cong insurrection, if we can use World War II as an example. President Johnson was always presented with options that could have truly devastated North Vietnam, but it would have amounted to the amount of civilian casualties that he simply was not willing to take responsibility for. He could have flooded much of North Vietnam like the USAF flooded the Rhine valley. He was never willing to strike the most important targets because they were very likely to have Russian advisors present, and he was not willing to start World War III.\n\nNo American administration was willing to really confront the problem of the corruption in the South Vietnamese leadership. While the USAF was obliterating the Ho Chi Minh trail, the ARVN leadership was selling war material to the Viet Cong. The ARVN leadership was fleecing their own people and putting them into relocation camps not to protect them but to take their land.\n\nPresident Nixon was often using action in the Vietnam war as cover for his domestic problems, as stated in an interview with Pat Buchanan. He was willing to make an uneven peace in 1973 to get peoples' minds off of other problems.\n\nThe war was not lost by the soldiers, it was lost by the politicians in Washington and in Saigon."

3891,"The 2nd Amendment, along with the other Amendments from the Bill of Rights, were designed to overthrow the federal government if it became too oppressive. Look at the entire Bill of Rights...almost all of the Amendments would be ESSENTIAL to overthrow a Government.\n\nThe individuals responsible for the Bill of Rights were opposed to a federal government. They insisted that the Bill of Rights be attached before they would ratify the Constitution. They are usually referred to today as the ""Anti-Federalists"", and those who were for the federal government were known as the ""Federalists"". \n\nYou can find some of the writings of the Anti-Federalists online, and there are some books printed that have their collective writings in them. Read them and you'll understand their thoughts, fears, and reasonings behind the Bill of Rights. \n\nMost people today, including the ACLU, are IGNORANT about the Bill of Rights.

Unstead of trying to do things to get more knowledgable, such as doing research, contacting politicians, etc, they just listen to what the media says or what someone else's opinions are, and then they make their opinions the same. Also, when things don't go people's ways, or when usual things are disrrupted, they blame the President. Case in point, the gas prices. Bush doesn't control if the prices go up or down, but as stated above, people base things on what they hear or read, instead of making their own opinion."

Strangely enough many believe the fantasy that Iraq is a whooping success story.  Forget about the forty odd people who die a day, forget about the fact that the US supported Iraqi government doesnt control an inch of dust outside of its precious greenzone. Some will still harp on about the relationship between Saddam and Al-Qaeda even though its been clearly proven that no such relationship existed. Some will castigate you for believing what they call liberal media propoganda, the voice of the hippies for spelling out the truth before them. If they only knew that they themselves are the subjects of a more vicious  propoganda effort by there leaders whom they blindly follow. Others will castigate you in the name of freedom trying to convince you and their own conscience that this is all about dear freedom.    In anycase it doesnt matter who's money it is because no serious rebuilding was planned or intended in the first place.

The moment came in the middle of the film when, during a nightclub scene, Jolson suddenly spoke.\n\n\n The first words ever spoken in a movie were, “Wait a minute, wait a minute.

The solution would be that the United States Government stopped intervening in Latin American politics as much and let them have a socialist kind of government. Uncle Sam wants every country to have their kind of democracy, but they don't realize that it only works with educated people. Most people in the U.S. have a fairly good education, but this is not the case with many Latin American countries.\n\nLet's take Chile as an example, which is the country with the strongest economy in Latin America. They used to be consiered ""third world"" as well, until President Pinochet got into power and he FORCED children to get an education. After many years of ruling this country, he finally ended his term but now Chile has a strong economy and good education. I would guess that if that happened in every Latin American country then we would all be a different continent. Contact me if you have any thoughts about this."

Petroleum distributors who deliver biodiesel to retail outlets and other customers in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area can now load pre-blended biodiesel on their tanker trucks. This allows distributors to get more biodiesel distributed, as the deal eliminates the additional cost and inconvenience of making two stops to obtain the biodiesel and petroleum diesel, and purchasing blending equipment. Motiva, a partnership between Shell Oil Co. and Saudi Refining Inc., is among the first major oil companies to provide a blending and loading terminal for the alternative fuel; other refiners who already blend biodiesel at the terminal level include Valero Energy Corp. and Tesoro Corp. Biodiesel kingpin Willie Nelson was joined by fellow booster Morgan Freeman to announce the installation of a 30,000-gallon heated tank that will allow biodiesel to be loaded onto tanker trucks already fully blended with petroleum diesel."""

4084,"Winston Churchill, Political Leader / Writer / World War II Figure \n\nBorn: 30 November 1874 \nBirthplace: Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, England \nDied: 24 January 1965 \nBest Known As: Indefatigable prime minister of Britain during World War II \nSoldier, politician and finally prime minister, Winston Churchill was one of Britain's greatest 20th-century heroes. Churchill fought with the British Army in India and Sudan, and as a journalist was captured in South Africa (where his dispatches from the Boer War first brought him to public prominence). He became a member of Parliament in 1900 and remained an MP for over 64 years. His early topsy-turvy political career earned him many enemies, but his stirring speeches, bulldog tenacity and his refusal to make peace with Adolf Hitler made him the popular choice to lead England through World War II. When Britain and its allies prevailed in 1945, Churchill's place in history was assured. (Ironically, he lost the prime ministership two months after Germany's surrender, when the opposition Labor Party took majority control of Parliament.) One of the 20th century's most quotable wits, Churchill wrote a plethora of histories, biographies and memoirs, including the landmark four-volume A History of the English-speaking Peoples (1956-58). In 1953 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature; he was knighted the same year.\n\nChurchill served as prime minister from 1940-45 and again from 1951-55... His wartime contemporaries included presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin... More recent British PMs have included Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair... The famous portrait of a scowling Churchill was taken by Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh.\n\nBritish politician and writer. As prime minister (1940–1945 and 1951–1955) he led Great Britain through World War II. Churchill published several works, including The Second World War (1948–1953), and won the 1953 Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nEarly Career\n\nEducated at Harrow and Sandhurst, he became (1894) an officer in the 4th hussars. On leave in 1895, he saw his first military action in Cuba as a reporter for London's Daily Graphic. He served in India and in 1898 fought at Omdurman in Sudan under Kitchener. Having resigned his commission, he was sent (1899) to cover the South African War by the Morning Post, and his accounts of his capture and imprisonment by the Boers and his escape raised him to the forefront of English journalists.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nEarly Government Posts\n\nChurchill was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in 1900, but he subsequently switched to the Liberal party and was appointed undersecretary for the colonies in the cabinet of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Under Asquith, he was initially (1908–10) president of the Board of Trade, then home secretary (1910–11), and championed innovative labor exchange and old-age pension acts. As first lord of the admiralty (1911), he presided over the naval expansion that preceded World War I.\n\nDiscredited by the failure of the Dardanelles expedition, which he had championed, Churchill lost (1915) his admiralty post and served on the front lines in France. Returning to office under Lloyd George, he served as minister of munitions (1917) and secretary of state for war and for air (1918–21). As colonial secretary (1921–22), he helped negotiate the treaty that set up the Irish Free State.\n\nAfter two defeats at the polls he returned to the House of Commons, as a Constitutionalist, and became (1924–29) chancellor of the exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government. As an advocate of laissez-faire economics, he was strongly criticized by John Maynard Keynes. Churchill was not a financial innovator; he basically followed conventional advice from his colleagues. Nevertheless, Churchill's decision to return the country to the prewar gold standard in"

4165,"It is quite possible that not everyone is as diligent in their work as you are. Also very possible that the workers in question think they are helping by doing what they do. Alot of the people in question had children who were American citzens, though their parents are not. Because the children themselves are eligible citizens, they can get welfare or food stamps to feed them. In fact, through an article in the L.A times, the county supervisor said that about 100,000 children of illegal immigrants in the county collect $276 million in annual welfare benefits. He also stated that 98,703 children of 57,458 undocumented parents received Cal-WORKS welfare checks in January, or a total of 156,161 recipients. Most of this was because the children were citizens. Though I am not familiar with Cal-Works or what benefit it entails, studies have found that due to 1996 restrictions, it is harder for illegals as well as natives to get welfare. But, the proportion of illegals who get food stamps and medacaid is significantly higher than that of the native population. In fact, it was found post 1996 reform that the percent of illegals who naturalized jumped significantly, all among those who had once received aid. It was also found that one in three families headed by an illegal immigrant is using one type of welfare or another. And because they are not usually educated people and are often low skill workers, the ones that do contribute taxes contribute much less than other families. For this reason, if we legalized them tax payments would increase 77%, but the net deficit would rise to 117%, because they would be legal to receive all the services that they are currently having difficulty accessing now."

4188,"They've been doing it for a long time, and most likely focused on their training much more intensely and specifically than the average person. They now train with power meters and heart rate monitors, as well as doing specific testing with coaches and doctors to optimize their performance.\n\nMaximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and Lactate Threshold (LT) are the things the pros work on religiously. Natural ability/genetics have some say in things, but LT is highly trainable.\n\n40 kph isn't all that fast for the pros. When riding in the pack, riders benefit from the drafting effect, saving up to 30-40% of the  effort of the riders taking the full brunt of the wind. The professional peloton can cruise along at well over 40 kph for hours on end.\n\nIn individual time trials (albeit the effort isn't necessarily long, per se), average speeds of over 50 kph have been recorded. Sprinters can get the speed up to over 70 kph in a finale of a race. The same can be said for track sprinters (the fastest kilo ever done was clocked at just under one minute, and that's from a standing start).\n\nTheir bikes, especially their time trial bikes, helmets and clothing, have all been designed to minimize drag and save time. Teams now regularly use wind tunnels to test equipment and fine tune riders' positions to further help in this endeavor.\n\nAnd yes, riders do dope up. Whether it's steroids, EPO (red blood cell producing drug), or blood doping (transfusion of blood into the rider's system) it's an ugly side of the sport that is a very real problem. It'll make riders fast, but it also puts their health at risk.\n\nThe theory is that blood doping or EPO makes more red blood cells. Red blood cells are what transport oxygen throughout the body. So the thought is that more is better. The only problem is that it also makes the blood thicker. When EPO started showing up in the early 90s, riders were dying in their sleep from heart attacks brought on by the thickened blood. One abused it so much that he said that he'd have to take an aspirin every night before going to bed to thin out his blood."

Connor, Marlo, Christian, Matt, Julia, Anne and his father. He is afraid that many of their choices will backfire.\nOne thing to notice is they wrote in nothing about Kimber or the baby. What they wrote about is Anne having issues with her Princess party, Matt following in his fathers' footsteps, Connor thinking like Shawn that he ruined his parents' marriage, and Julia still having a relationship with Marlo even after they broke up in the last episode. In short this one long nightmare in the midst of the storm. When the storm is over, however, they are talking about having to rebuild things and that takes times. They are talking allegoically about their relationship and about the city damage.  Julia flies off to New York with the children and Shawn stays behind to clean things up in Miami.

Herans being the much taller of the two would throw his right hand at will and catch Giardello every time he threw it. Joey was notorious for getting hit a lot.\n                    A little inside bit for you, Augie Semeca who use to be Charles Brewer's trainer and one time South Philadelphia Gym owner and I were talking a couple months back at Joe Hands Gym in South Philly about tough fighters from Philly and I brought up Giardello and about two minutes later Joey came walking through the door. He sat down and started talking to Augie and Augie introduced me to him, anyways to make a long story short and without pulling any punches Joey said ""I never trained, I'd be out with the boys all of the time, I didn't have time to train, there was too much going on. I was always a tough kid and could handle my own, but I never fully dedicated myself to the sport.""\n     Tommy's workouts with Steward at the Kronk Gym are legendary. I worked out at the gym before and it's always HOT in there no matter what time of the year you're there. Tommy worked the pads with Manny and it would resemble a actual fight. Tommy would hit the bag for a hour straight with only a minute rest between rounds. Milton McCory would often be heard saying ""That man aint right, alls he wants to do is train like a crazy man""\n     This would be the biggest difference in this fight Tommy would be able to go non-stop until he stops Giardello, don't get me wrong here, Joey wouldn't be a push over he'd crack Tommy with some good shots too, but it wouldn't be enough to keep Tommy off of him."

4240,"First off ... .Cool name~!\n\nHere is 25 reasons for ya. \n\n25 REASONS TO FEEL BAD ABOUT BUSH\n\nEconomic Indicators\n\n1. The unemployment rate averaged 4.1 percent in 2000 and reached a 30 year low of 3.9 percent in October 2000. Today, the unemployment rate has increased to 5.7 percent. There are presently 8.1 million unemployed Americans, an increase of 2.5 million compared to 2000\n\n2. The number of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment-over 27 weeks-has almost doubled in the last year.\n\n3. Job creation has reversed. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the economy created 1.7 million new jobs. This trend has been reversed, and the economy has lost almost 1.5 million jobs since President Bush took office in January 2001.\n\n4. Poverty is increasing. After decreasing for eight straight years and reaching its lowest level in 25 years, the poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 11.7 percent in 2001. In the first year of the Bush administration, 1.3 million Americans slipped back into poverty, with a total of 32.9 million Americans living in poverty in 2001.\n\n5. Incomes are falling. After increasing every year since 1991, and reaching an all time high in 2000, median household income in the United States fell 2.2 percent in 2001. Median incomes fell for households in every income group in the country except for those earning over $150,000.\n\n6. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are filing for bankruptcy. Almost 800,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2002. In the second quarter of 2002, over 400,000 bankruptcies were filed in the United States, an all-time record.\n\n7. Mortgage foreclosures are at record highs. In the second quarter of 2002, 1.23 percent of home loans were in the foreclosure process, a record level. Over this same time period, almost 5 percent of mortgage loans were delinquent, up almost 20 percent from the average delinquency rate in 2000.\n\n8. The federal budget deficit is increasing. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the federal budget, excluding Social Security, showed a surplus of $86.6 billion. The most recent figures from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that for FY 2002, the federal budget, excluding Social Security, will show a deficit of $314 billion.\n\n9. This represents the largest budget decline in U.S. history, and it is the third-largest on-budget deficit in history, exceeded in size only by the deficits of 1991 and 1992 under the first President Bush. Health Care Indicators\n\n10.The number of Americans without health insurance is increasing. Between 1999 and 2000, the number of uninsured Americans fell by 600,000.\n\n11. But this trend has reversed itself and in 2001 the number of uninsured Americans increased by 1.4 million.\n\n12. Over 41 million Americans — 14.6 percent of the population — had no health insurance coverage in 2001.\n\n13. The percentage of small businesses offering insurance to their employees fell by 10 percent between 2000 and 2002.\n\n14. Insurance costs increased by 12.7 percent in 2002, the second consecutive year of double-digit increases and the largest annual increase in costs since 1990.\n\n15. Prescription drug prices increased by almost twice the rate of inflation in 2001.\n\n16. For seniors, who use the most prescription drugs, cost increases were even higher. The cost of the 50 most popular drugs for seniors increased by 7.8 percent in 2001, over three times the rate of inflation. The price of Prilosec, the most popular drug for seniors, increased at over four times the rate of inflation.\n\nCrime and Drug Use Indicators\n\n17.The crime rate is increasing. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the crime rate reached its lowest level since 1972. This represented the culmination of a 22 percent decrease in crime during the 1990s.\n\n18. But in 2001, the crime rate increased by 2.2 percent. The murder rate increased by 3.1 percent, the robbery rate inc"

4332,"Advantages of Mutual Funds\n\n\nThe advantages of investing in a Mutual Fund are:\n\n    * Diversification: The best mutual funds design their portfolios so individual investments will react differently to the same economic conditions. For example, economic conditions like a rise in interest rates may cause certain securities in a diversified portfolio to decrease in value. Other securities in the portfolio will respond to the same economic conditions by increasing in value. When a portfolio is balanced in this way, the value of the overall portfolio should gradually increase over time, even if some securities lose value.\n\n    * Professional Management:Most mutual funds pay topflight professionals to manage their investments. These managers decide what securities the fund will buy and sell.\n\n    * Regulatory oversight: Mutual funds are subject to many government regulations that protect investors from fraud.\n\n    * Liquidity: It's easy to get your money out of a mutual fund. Write a check, make a call, and you've got the cash.\n\n    * Convenience: You can usually buy mutual fund shares by mail, phone, or over the Internet.\n\n    * Low cost: Mutual fund expenses are often no more than 1.5 percent of your investment. Expenses for Index Funds are less than that, because index funds are not actively managed. Instead, they automatically buy stock in companies that are listed on a specific index\n\n    * Transparency\n\n    * Flexibility\n\n    * Choice of schemes\n\n    * Tax benefits\n\n    * Well regulated"

So to me, sounds logical that a child that does not graduate will not get funding (bank loans).  On the military issue, they have already dropped the strict requirements on entry due to the many now out of commission, either through death or through disability.  They will take whatever they can get, including many immigrants who've not received American citizenship.  Those who are less educated only need to know one thing in the military . . how to shoot a gun.  They can teach them that and send them to the frontline as expendables."
4345,actually on this one i would have to agree somewhat with you. In FB the schools are complaining that if the ordinances that they passed go into effect many parents will leave and take their children with them.They argued that they get a percentage of money from the federal government depending on how many students they have in their school district and get extra money for all the classes they have that are ESL.personally I didn't know that was true but I guess that explains a whole lot why a lot of schools are so determined to have more kids in theirs school district and why many of them have a lot of ESL classes.all about the money.

4393,"Four problems.\n\nThe first is that the military includes a massive amount of psychological conditioning, and can be very demoralizing. It's  basically government-sponsored indoctrination, and (if compelled) that's a potential constitutional problem because it requires people to accept/support a government-sponsored/approved message. There's also the freedom of association problem, in addition to the free speech problem.\n\nSecond, not everyone is physically capable of meeting requirements for enlistment. That means either dual standards, which is always a bad idea, or you end up with kids having a way out by choosing to be unhealthy. Worse idea.\n\nThird, the military currently discriminates based on sexual orientation. So again, you're either going to have a dual standard, or people will be in violation of the law based on their sexual preferences. ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" is/was a huge disaster when the military was volunteer. It gets much worse when service is mandatory.\n\nFinally, many people and many religions do not support the use of force to solve problems. The military mindset is might-makes-right. That's why conscientious objector status exists. Mandatory service would brand everyone who didn't serve as an outside, in many cases based on their religious beliefs. That is again government-sponsored viewpoint-based religious discrimination, and that's also against the constitution."

4405,"A reverse proxy is a proxy server that is installed within the neighborhood of one or more servers. Typically, reverse proxies are utilized in front of webservers. All connections coming from the Internet addressed to one of the webservers are routed through the proxy server, which may either entirely deal with the request itself, or pass the request wholly or partially to the main webserver.\n\nThere are several reasons for installing reverse proxy servers:\n\n    * Security: the proxy server is an additional layer of defense and therefore protects the webservers further up the chain\n    * Encryption / SSL acceleration: when secure websites are created, the SSL encryption is sometimes not done by the webserver itself, but by a reverse proxy that is equipped with SSL acceleration hardware.\n    * Load distribution: the reverse proxy can distribute the load to several servers, each server serving its own application area. In the case of reverse proxying in the neighborhood of webservers, the reverse proxy may need to have to rewrite the URL's in each webpage (translation from externally known URLs to the internal locations)\n    * Caching static content: A reverse proxy can offload the webservers by caching static content, such as images. Proxy caching of this sort can often satisfy a considerable amount of website requests, greatly reducing the load on the central web server."

4442,"Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (Russian: И́горь Фёдорович Страви́нский Igor' Fëdorovič Stravinskij) (June 17, 1882 – April 6, 1971) was a Russian-born composer of modern classical music. He composed in the primitivist, neo-classical and serialist styles, but he is best known for three works from his earlier, Russian period: Le sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring), Petrushka and L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). For some, these daring and innovative ballets practically reinvented the genre. Stravinsky also wrote in a broad spectrum of ensemble combinations and classical forms. His oeuvre included everything from symphonies to piano miniatures.\n\nStravinsky also achieved fame as a pianist and conductor, often at the premieres of his own works. He was also a writer. With the help of Alexis Roland-Manuel, Stravinsky composed a theoretical work entitled Poetics of Music. In it, he famously claimed that music was incapable of ""expressing anything but itself"". Robert Craft transcribed several interviews with the composer, which were published as Conversations with Stravinsky.\n\nA quintessentially cosmopolitan Russian, Stravinsky was one of the most influential composers and artists of 20th century music, both in the West and in his native land. He was named by Time magazine as one of the most influential people of the century.\n\nStravinsky was born in Oranienbaum (now Lomonosov), near St. Petersburg, Russia. Brought up in St. Petersburg and dominated by his father and elder brother, Stravinsky's early childhood was a mix of experience that hinted little at the cosmopolitan artist he was to become. Although his father Fyodor Stravinsky was a bass singer at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Stravinsky originally studied to be a lawyer. He switched to composition later. In 1902, at the age of 20, Stravinsky became the pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, probably the leading Russian composer of the time.\n\nStravinsky left Russia for the first time in 1910, going to Paris to attend the premiere of his ballet L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). During his stay in the city, he composed two further works for the Ballets Russes—Petrushka (1911) and Le Sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring) (1913). The ballets trace his stylistic development: from the L'oiseau de feu, whose style draws largely on Rimsky-Korsakov, to Petrushka's emphasis on bitonality, and finally to the savage polyphonic dissonance of Le Sacre du printemps. As Stravinsky noted about the premieres, his intention was ""[to send] them all to hell"". (He succeeded: the 1913 première of Le sacre du printemps was probably the most famous riot in music history).\n\nStravinsky displayed an inexhaustible desire to learn and explore art, literature, and life. This desire manifested itself in several of his Paris collaborations. Not only was he the principal composer for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballet Russes, but he also collaborated with Pablo Picasso (Pulcinella, 1920), Jean Cocteau (Oedipus Rex, 1927) and George Balanchine (Apollon Musagete, 1928).\n\nRelatively short of stature and not conventionally handsome, Stravinsky was nevertheless photogenic, as many pictures show. He was still young when, on 23 January 1906, he married his cousin Katerina Nossenko whom he had known since early childhood. Their marriage endured for 33 years, but the true love of his life, and later his partner until his death, was his second wife Vera de Bosset (1888-1982). Although a notorious philanderer (even rumoured to have affairs with high-class partners such as Coco Chanel), Stravinsky was also a family man who devoted considerable amounts of his time and expenditure to his sons and daughters. One of his sons, Soulima Stravinsky, was also a composer, but is little known compared to his father.\n\nWhen Stravinsky met Vera in the early 1920s, she was married to the painter and stage designer Serge Sudeikin, but they soon began"

4460,"bnp is the most corrupt & racist of all...theyre not even a real party.\nthe bnp ""is wholly opposed to any form of racial integration between British and non-European peoples"" and is therefore committed to ""restoring, by legal changes, negotiation and consent the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948"". To achieve this aim, the BNP advocates the use of ""firm but voluntary incentives"" to remove ethnic minorities from the UK. Membership of the party is restricted to ""Indigenous Caucasians"". A British National Party European election candidate in the Eastern region had close links in the 1980s with a convicted criminal and two notorious paedophiles. \nSid Chaney, an elderly former Londoner and Islington National Front officer who now lives in Essex, is sixth on the BNP's list for Eastern England and a council election candidate in Basildon. In the 1980s his circle of friends included Desmond Fenwick, who was involved in a number of police investigations into horrific murders of gay men, and George Wilson, who had a liking for very young boys. \nChaney was around when a gang of teenage armed robbers, who were politically involved with both the NF and the extreme nazi British Movement, were frequent visitors to Wilson's flat, which doubled as the local NF headquarters. \nPaedophilia is one of the most dreadful crimes against children. The BNP has made paedophilia a major plank of its 2004 election campaign and has tried to barge in on local campaigns on the issue. Now Searchlight reveals the BNP's own dirty secrets as a service to voters to warn them of the type of people who are campaigning for their votes. \nSearchlight published the full story of Chaney and his disgusting circle of friends and fellow fascists in Islington in September 1985 in conjunction with the Daily Mirror. Space precluded us from reproducing it in this month's Searchlight but you can read it here on our website and make up your own mind about the BNP's criminal hypocrisy. The British National Party will be fielding a total of 21 candidates in London on 10 June although some of them are doubling up. As Searchlight went to press the party had named candidates for all 11 London-wide seats in the London Assembly, a mayoral candidate who is also standing for the Assembly and a full list of nine for the London constituency in the European election. The BNP website includes photographs and short biographies of the party's candidates around the country except that, with four weeks to go until polling day, some photos and several biographies for the London candidates were still missing. This may be because many of the candidates' past activities are rather embarrassing for Nick Griffin's new ""clean"" BNP. The many candidates with criminal convictions and a penchant for the policies of Hitler's Third Reich reflect how poorly organised the BNP is in London. In pole position on the London European list is Chris Roberts. Not a serious choice, this former alleged City high flyer has been described as a man from some village that is missing its idiot - and this was by a fellow BNP member. He is the brother of the notorious Barry Roberts, who is number 2 on the London Assembly list. Whereas Chris lives in leafy Essex and has long abandoned London, his brother still resides in southeast London where he grew up in the company of the openly nazi and violent British Movement and the National Front. After belatedly turning to the BNP, Barry Roberts was among those who guarded a meeting addressed by the arch liar and Holocaust denier David Irving, alongside leading violent members of the nazi terror group Combat 18, such as Charlie Sargent, who is now serving a life sentence for murder. \nChris Roberts is very coy about his early politics but a rumoured early link with US extremists may account for his love of the USA and his abandoning of the "

And of course, shot technique (regardless if it goes in or not)\n\nThings you can do include the following drills:\n\n1.  Jump stop and pivot with both legs (front and back pivot).  Start from one baseline and jog to the other baseline, and do a jump stop and a pivot in the free-throw line, half-court, other side free-throw line, and then finally baseline on the other side.\n2.  Dribble between cones with your head up (since you admit not being a good dribbler, this will help you out), and at 5'9"", you will need dribbling skills.  Warm-up by dribbling in one place for 5 minutes with your head up.  REMEMBER, practice more with your OFF HAND.  (less dominant hand)\n3.  Learn to set picks and move with out the ball...coaches love players who can do this with-out being told.  This unfortunately can only be learned by playing alot, but while you are playing, try not to ask for the ball, instead, try setting picks and opening up other players for a shot.\n4.  As far as shot techniques, you can do a few drills...my favorite is when a player starting above the top of the key dribbles toward the shoulder of the free-throw line and takes a shot.  Another drill would be starting from the sideline then heading toward the free-throw, have someone to pass you the ball from the otherside, and then pivot and shoot at the same time.  Pretend you are coming off a curl or screen.\n\nHope this helps you get started."

That means that, while you're entitled to a different lawyer, you'll probably end up paying attorneys twice before taking your share.\n\nIt sounds to me as though your lawyer's opinions about the case are accurate and his actions are reasonable although I can't be sure.  Turning over your medical records is something you'll have to do in a lawsuit.  The amount you sue for is usually just a made up number with no relationship to anything.  (In my state, you don't even put an amount in the complaint anymore.)\n\nIt sounds like your real problem is one of communication.  You should have a good relationship with your lawyer and should be able to speak with him at length until you understand his advice.  If you don't trust your lawyer, something's wrong.  My advice is to call your lawyer and say just that:  I don't understand what you're doing and I don't trust you.  Ask him to sit with you and explain everything that is happening.  Then have a consultation with another personal injury lawyer to see if what you were told makes sense.\n\nIf your lawyer communicates with you appropriately, I'm sure you'll feel a lot better and the entire process will end up being much easier for you."

4534,"Jennifer was born on July 24, 1969 in the Castle Hill section of the Bronx. Her father, David, was a computer technician. Her mother, Guadalupe, taught kindergarten. Jennifer is the middle of three daughters. Her elder sister, Leslie, is a housewife who sings opera. Her younger sister, Lynda, is a DJ on New York's WKTU, a VH1 VJ., and a morning news show correspondent on New York's Channel 11. Jennifer's parents were born in Puerto Rico, but did not meet until both came to America. Her mother's parents were Europeans who settled in Puerto Rico. She says that it was her parents' work ethic that made a difference in her life. Jennifer took singing and dancing lessons from age 5. She attended 12 years of Catholic school, including an all-girl high school. She played softball and tennis in high school and was a gymnast.\n\nAfter high school, she briefly worked in a law office. During this time, she continued dance classes at night. At 18, she left home because her mother was scared by her decision to pursue show business. With casting on ""In Living Color"" (1990) in 1990, she moved to L.A., but initially hated it. Finally her boy friend, David Cruz, moved to be with her there and she learned to accept her new environment. Her career took off from her ""Living Color"" stint and reached new peaks with her portrayal of slain Latino singer Selena (1997) in 1997.\nRelationships\n\nLópez is notorious for her multiple relationships. She has been married three times, and dated numerous men during her career.\n\nHer first marriage, to waiter Ojani Noa, occurred on February 22, 1997. He was later named the manager of López' restaurant, Madre's. They divorced in January 1998. On April 10, 2006, López sued Noa, claiming he breached a confidentiality agreement he signed by shopping around a tell-all book about their relationship.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, she dated rapper and producer Sean ""Diddy"" Combs (then known as Sean ""Puff Daddy"" or simply ""Puffy"" Combs). Both were arrested in connection with a nightclub shooting in December 1999. Police found them in possession of a stolen gun. The charges against López were dropped. Combs was indicted but was eventually tried and acquitted. The adverse publicity caused a great deal of stress on the relationship, and their breakup was announced (ironically enough) on Valentine's Day, 2001.\n\nHer second marriage was to Chris Judd, her former backup dancer. She met Judd while filming the music video for her single ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"". The two were married on September 29, 2001 at a home in a Los Angeles suburb officiated by attorney Barry Hirsch. The marriage ended in June 2002, during which time she reportedly had started dating actor Ben Affleck.\n\nLópez announced her engagement to Affleck in October 2002, after Affleck gave her a ring worth a reported $3.5 million. The marriage, planned for September 14, 2003 in Santa Barbara, California, was called off just a few days before the event. She and Affleck split for good in January 2004. Their relationship was parodied on the South Park episode, ""Fat Butt and Pancake Head"" that aired on April 16, 2003. By this time López was involved with singer Marc Anthony, who was married at that time.\n\nLópez married Anthony in a secret wedding on June 5, 2004, less than a week after his divorce was finalized from former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres. The guests were invited to an ""afternoon party"" without knowing that they were going to a wedding. Years before they married (or even became a couple), she and Marc Anthony sang a song together called ""No Me Ames"" which appeared on her album On The 6.\n\nAlmost immediately, rumors began that the ceremony was a ""shotgun"" and that López was pregnant. López had said in the past that, as a practicing Catholic, she would never have a baby without being married. Complicating the situ"

4539,"Definitely the best modern day pitcher and probably top five all-time. The problem with comparing him to a guy like Grove or Young is that the advent of five-man rotations and relief pitchers changed things so much. Five-man rotations meant less starts and relievers meant a pitcher could run out of gas in the sixth but have someone else finish his win for him.\n\nThe problem with Clemens is he doesn't lead career strikeouts, wins, or winning percentage, so it's hard to say he's OBVIOUSLY the best ever. He has alot of Cy Young awards but that's just as much a measure of league talent as it is an individual pitcher's talent. Top Five in no particular order: Clemens, Carlton, Walter Johnson, Warren Spahn, Cy Young."

What that means is in a bunch of different statistical categories your fantasy team (so Kobe Bryant, Shaq, Tim Duncan etc - the guys on your roster under the 'my team' page) earn you points in each category.\n\nThe way the league works means that in each category if your team scores say 150 rebounds on day one and that is more than the other teams in your fantasy league - for the rebound stat category - you'll earn 12 (if it is a 12 team league) points towards your Overall League total.\n\nBut say the next day you get just 15 rebounds from your team - and say 5 other teams get enough rebounds to go past your total (150+15) then you'll only get 7 points towards your Overall League total = Meaning you'll get -5 points in your total.\n\nThis applies for all the categories - so today you might've dropped 15 points but if your players go really well tomorrow - you might improve by 15 points!\n\nThe aim is by the end of the season to have more Overall Points than the other 11 teams in your league obviously - but it isn't easy so make sure you check your team regularly to give yourself every chance of winning!"

The 5 cents you pay is for deposit. The state expects you to give it back- to a recycling center, that is. Once you do that, they give you your 5 cents back. \n\nYour 4-cent back deal is not sanctioned by the state. Assumedly, whatever center you give it back to charges 1 cent for the service.\n\nI was thinking as I was answering this question: ""Why then, does the state not give you the money when you put the bottles in the recycling bin outside your home?"" I assume the answer is similar to the 4-cent back answer: That the county, by picking it up, is charging you the 5 cents for the service. Why, then, is it required in some places? Because the requirement is that you don't put the bottle in the trash, not that you HAVE to use their service to get rid of them."

4565,"Welfare is financial assistance paid by the government to certain entities or groups of people who are unable to support themselves alone, or are perceived by the government to be able to function more effectively with financial assistance. Some welfare is general, while some are specific and can only be invoked under certain circumstances, such as a scholarship. Welfare can be given to both individuals, or be given to companies or entities, which take place as corporate welfare.\n\nReasons for individuals being unable to support themselves alone might be unemployment, disability, lack of education or some other reason. Assistance may also take form of other relief, such as tax credits for working mothers. Welfare is known by a variety of names in different countries, all with the fundamental purpose of providing an economic or social safety net for disadvantaged members of society. Almost all developed nations provide some kind of safety net of this kind; the governments of those nations where this is especially prominent are known as welfare states.\n\nThe desired outcome and purpose of welfare varies. For individual welfare for the non-disabled, the purpose of welfare often is to provide those who require financial assistance in order to attain a higher income in the first place, especially for those who are perceived to be stuck in the cycle of poverty. The justification for financial assistance to such individuals often cites the requirement for existing financial resources in order to attain tertiary education that would allow individuals to gain more income, and thereby get out of welfare eventually. Welfare for the disabled, in contrast, does not eventually expect non-dependency, and the justification is more philosophical. Welfare may be given to entities as corporate welfare in order to provide capita to industry are perceived by the government to need financial assistance in order to survive or to expand but are thought by the government to be valuable industries eventually and will eventually become non-dependent.\n\nSome of these ideal outcomes and purposes, as well as welfare's effectiveness have been challenged by political lobbies such as those who oppose big government, such as minarchists or libertarians.\n\nPersonal Welfare:\nThe amounts paid to individuals are typically very low, and may fall below the poverty line. Recipients must usually demonstrate a low level of income such as by way of ""means testing"", or financial hardship, or that they satisfy some other requirement such as childcare responsibilities or disability. Those receiving unemployment benefits may also have to regularly demonstrate that they are periodically searching for employment. Some countries assign specific jobs to recipients who must work in these roles in order for welfare payments to continue. In the United States and Canada, such programs are known as workfare."

4585,"Technically a web server is a web service - of sorts.  It responds to HTTP requests, typically with HTML documents.  However, the documents do not adhere to the SOAP standards implemented by most newer web services so the only recourse is to hunt the HTML for keywords and tags that indicate where the data you're scraping for is located.\n\nSince you have some practical limitations on how frequently these devices could be called, my first inclination would be to develop a centralized ""collection"" service that periodically polled the various clarity monitoring devices and stored the data in a local database (timestamped from an accurate, central time source).  It would still do the ""scraping"" from the various devices, but would act as a proxy to minimize the amount of traffic each device was required to handle.  The polling interval would be based upon how frequently you needed to update the data.\n\nI'm assuming these devices can be accessed via TCP/IP.  Lacking any drawing tools, the architecture is fairly simple.  \n\n[Polling Server] -- [Clarity Monitoring Devices]\n    |\n    |\n[Database Server]\n    |\n    |\n[Web Service]\n    |\n    |\n[Clients] or [Web Server]\n\nWhat would help is if you have the ability to modify the web page on the monitoring devices.  If so you could customize the HTML response to conform to a standard SOAP document that could be called as a remote object from the polling server (instead of having to parse the HTML).  Alternatively, you may also be able to have the web server on the monitoring devices respond in an XML format that can be much more easily parsed by the Polling Server.  I am assuming this is possible since the web server on these devices provides clarity information on-demand (which typically requires some sort of scripting).\n\nIf you would like additional details, please e-mail me at melancholygiant@yahoo.com."

4655,"cause he's an alchoholic\n\nthe connection with corn liquor produced in the South, since corn is ""cracked"" before being mixed with other ingredients and fermented into alcohol. In the US, this industry is strongly associated with Southern states, especially the illegal ""moonshine"" corn whiskey that was produced secretly to avoid government taxation in the 1800s. On a recent visit to my parents, who live down in North Carolina, we visited a cultural museum where one of the featured exhibits was a still (the equipment for producing corn whiskey.) To the best of my knowledge, there are no stills in museums up here in Boston. Most sources that believe this to be the root of the word point to song The Blue Tail Fly (more popularly known as Jimmy Crack Corn) which tells the story of a slave who escapes punishment when his master is killed in a riding accident - even though it happened because he failed to keep flies from biting the master's nervous horse."
4656,"In its most general sense, virginity is characterized by a state of unimpacted purity, usually stemming from a lack of experience (for example, newcomers to game Bingo could be referred to as virgins).

This use is traditionally restricted to a person who has not yet engaged in vaginal intercourse, but it is sometimes used to describe someone who has not engaged in sexual activities in general. Also, someone can be referred to as an ""anal virgin,"" being a virgin to anal sex (specifically receiving anal sex). The status of ""virginity"" is sometimes respected and valued in certain societies, especially in relation to views of many religions on sexual conduct before marriage. The term maiden is also sometimes used to mean a virgin, although that can also refer to an unmarried or merely young woman.\n\nBtw, some cultures and religions have slightly different meaning."

I'm not sure if you're asking about racing or completing the 3-5k. If you want to complete the 3-5k then I'd suggest start slow and gradually increase your pace over the duration. \nIf you're trying to race it then ...I ran crosscountry and track in college in the US and my tactic for the longer races (3km,5km and CC) was to hang with the leaders of the race as long as I could. Over time, and with specific training, I was able to keep up with the leaders and be competitive. My opinion is that trying to hang back in the early going and sprinting at the end was a bad tactic, because I was so far back I was never going to catch the leaders. Go out fast with the leaders..if you sense the pace is going too fast for you then begin to settle into the pace you can handle (but remember, the winner is the person who can handle the pain for the longest, so your handling pace should still have you in some mild discomfort). Always look ahead and see if you can pick off the runner ahead of you. Some of this depends on your goals - do you want to win, do you want a fast time, are you training enough etc. Anyway, hope this helped."

4699,"Short for IP Security, a set of protocols developed by the IETF to support secure exchange of packets at the IP layer. IPsec has been deployed widely to implement Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). \nIPsec supports two encryption modes: Transport and Tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet, but leaves the header untouched. The more secure Tunnel mode encrypts both the header and the payload. On the receiving side, an IPSec-compliant device decrypts each packet. \n\nFor IPsec to work, the sending and receiving devices must share a public key. This is accomplished through a protocol known as Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol/Oakley (ISAKMP/Oakley), which allows the receiver to obtain a public key and authenticate the sender using digital certificates. \n\n\nAlso:\n\nIPsec (IP security) is a standard for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by encrypting and/or authenticating all IP packets. IPsec provides security at the network layer.\n\nIPsec is a set of cryptographic protocols for (1) securing packet flows and (2) key exchange. Of the former, there are two: Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides authentication, data confidentiality and message integrity; Authentication Header (AH) provides authentication and message integrity, but does not offer confidentiality. Originally AH was only used for integrity and ESP was used only for encryption; authentication functionality was added subsequently to ESP. Currently only one key exchange protocol is defined, the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol.\n\nIPsec protocols operate at the network layer, layer 3 of the OSI model. Other Internet security protocols in widespread use, such as SSL and TLS, operate from the transport layer up (OSI layers 4 - 7). This makes IPsec more flexible, as it can be used for protecting both TCP and UDP-based protocols, but increases its complexity and processing overhead, as it cannot rely on TCP (layer 4 OSI model) to manage reliability and fragmentation."

Bresnahan \nApril 1, 2006 \nNewsWithViews.com \n\nDear President Bush: \n\nI’m about to plan a little trip with my family and extended family, and I would like to ask you to assist me. I’m going to walk across the border from the U.S. into Mexico, and I need to make a few arrangements. I know you can help with this. \n\nI plan to skip all the legal stuff like visas, passports, immigration quotas and laws.I’m sure they handle those things the same way you do here. \n\nSo, would you mind telling your buddy, President Vicente Fox, that I’m on my way over? Please let him know that I will be expecting the following: \n\n1. Free medical care for my entire family. \n2. English-speaking government bureaucrats for all services I might need, whether I use them or not. \n3. All government forms need to be printed in English. \n4. I want my kids to be taught by English-speaking teachers. \n5. Schools need to include classes on American culture and history. \n6. I want my kids to see the American flag flying on the top of the flag pole at their school with the Mexican flag flying lower down. \n7. Please plan to feed my kids at school for both breakfast and lunch. \n8. I will need a local Mexican driver’s license so I can get easy access to government services. \n9. I do not plan to have any car insurance, and I won’t make any effort to learn local traffic laws. \n10. In case one of the Mexican police officers does not get the memo from Pres. Fox to leave me alone, please be sure that all police officers speak English. \n11. I plan to fly the U.S. flag from my house top, put flag decals on my car, and have a gigantic celebration on July 4th. I do not want any complaints or negative comments from the locals. \n12. I would also like to have a nice job without paying any taxes, and don’t enforce any labor laws or tax laws. \n13. Please tell all the people in the country to be extremely nice and never say a critical word about me, or about the strain I might place on the economy. \n\nI know this is an easy request because you already do all these things for all the people who come to the U.S. from Mexico. I am sure that Pres. Fox won’t mind returning the favor if you ask him nicely. \n\nThank you so much for your kind help. \n\nSincerely, \n\nDavid M.

And you can take this neighbor to court. Show the judge her police records of theft and show the judge the debt she caused you to have with the bank etc. You can take her to small claims court and possibly recover what she stole and damages as well (like costs for looking for a new apartment+ security first and last month, utility deposits etc.\nYou can also sue the management that evicted you as well, for allowing this neighbor with her priors on the premises, which caused all of this.\n\nFind the strength to look for a place to live. Look towards apartment agencies which will look for a place for you even the section 8 office should have a list.\n\nLearn by your mistakes, never expect a debt, or even a bill to supercede your rent responsibilty.Because your gas can get cut off, your electric, your internet..and you will still have a roof over your head. Don't allow anything to come before your rent, at least you shouldn't do that.Renting is a buisiness, and managers/landlords got property mortgage and bills to pay themselves.\nYour bank should have forgiven all the loses when they were notified,all you had to do was tell them which debits you didn't authorize.\n\nTake what you will from my advice and good luck to you."

Being passed over in favor of the U.S. was a big irritant.\n\nSo, because of what amounts to a huge inferiority complex, they felt (and still feel) the need to hurt the U.S.  After the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, the disaster in Mogadishu, the 1998 embassy attacks in Africa, and the USS Cole attack, they figured the U.S. didn't have the guts to use force against them, beyond firing a couple of cruise missiles which may or may not have done anything serious besides blow up an aspirin factory in Sudan.\n\nThe Clinton administration didn't do anything to disabuse them of this notion; to their credit, mustering the kind of support needed would have been difficult in general, and impossible under his key supporters.  After several years of planning, 19 terrorists hijacked four airliners, and we all know the rest.\n\nPart of this was hoping that the U.S. would invade Afghanistan and then al-Qaeda could somehow cause the country's collapse.  Why did they think this?  Because, less than two years after the end of the Soviet occupation, the Soviet Union collapsed.  Any serious student of international relations knows, of course, that such thinking is, to say the least, deeply flawed, but that's what they thought.  Al-Qaeda also believed that we would deploy tanks & infantry and do what the Soviets did, assuming, of course, we would even have the will to fight, which he didn't believe we had.  So, what did happen came as a major surprise.\n\nHonestly, if anyone thinks that someone else caused 9/11, they're crazy.  Al-Qaeda did it after failing to blow it up in 1993."

You see, human beings are taught to handle personal matters discretely, and if you suddenly expressed your strong emotions to a person you'd probably throw him/her offguard. And of course the real key to having successful friendships and acquaintances with people is that you can control your emotions around them. You may feel angry, but you don't directly hit out at them, right? But if you're overjoyed, well then, I guess there isn't any harm in expressing yourself. \nRemember, it isn't wrong to show your emotions (and it's good to learn to control them), it's just that people are not used to it."

In other countries, it grew out of AFL exhibition matches, cult television following or Internet communication.

Bruiser Brody's a guy who did whatever he wanted to whomever he wanted all across the world and is arguably the greatest brawler of all-time. He influenced the modern hardcore style, changed the finishes of matches in the ring and despite his opponents best efforts, they couldn't do a damn thing about it in the ring. Brody's partner in Japan, Stan Hansen, was another guy who some say was even meaner than Brody and was even more sucessful, holding the AWA world championship and the All-Japan Triple Crown 4 times; no other Westerner has held it more than 2 times. And when you're talking about dominance and intensity, you simply can't forget the Road Warriors, the single greatest tag team of all-time and the only duo to hold the AWA, NWA and WWF tag team titles in their career.\n\nAnd by the way, it was the February 9, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro where Goldberg got manhandled by William Regal."

If you want fast, FedEx, UPS, DHL, and etc. can do things within a 24 hr. period if you're willing to spend the extra money. If you're shipping multiple items, these services will sometimes offer a discount. If you want cheap, go with the Postal service.

5026,"God. This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to. \nbut...\nThe Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in much the same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidance to people of other religions. If you and I could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief, Buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that? Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists that we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesus was not born of a literal virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical.""Sophie looked skeptical.

The Quibla wall in the prayer hall is carved with 11 recessed arches, while the mimber is made of black basalt. The structure is enlivened by the limpid expanse of water in the tank outside the northern wall. The monumentality of this structure was much greater originally when it faced the towering bastions of the Fatehgarh Fort. A three-day Ijtima congregation was held here annually draws people from all over the world but has recently been shifted outside the City. Bhopal has over 400 mosques.

The biggest problem is that you need a lot of plugins to do all the cool stuff, at least I did. Maya has most of the cool stuff already in the program, but it is harder to work with. It's not really much harder, just a slightly steeper learning curve. In the end, I would say it is good to know both if you plan to have a job in the field of 3D modeling or animation.

Up until recently, insurers were able to survive -- and in many cases do quite well -- because they made up losses through investment and asset management income. But 2001 proved to be a turning point. \n\nLast year was one of the most dismal underwriting years ever, and the asset management side of the insurance business began to falter due to the sinking stock market and volatility in the credit markets. \n\nMoreover, there was increased competitive pressure on insurance firms from financial services companies. \n\nInsurers are, of course, embracing all the prescribed measures for tough times, such as tighter underwriting requirements and participation in industry e-commerce endeavors. \n\nNevertheless, industry watchers and participants are witnessing a distinct movement toward CRM in the insurance sector as a novel way to beat the odds. \n\n""An insurance company is always interested in avoiding loss, whether that loss is paid out through settlements or through excessive administrative overhead,"" Aberdeen Group research director Denis Pombriant told CRMDaily."

5173,"The general American consensus seems to be negative towards immigrants. I've heard a lot of send them back, keep them out, deny them rights, sort of plans that are not logical, and can't be accomplished, and frankly, seem rather inhumane . I'm not exactly sure what goals we are looking to accomplish with the proposed legislation that the goverment is debating, however I think it won't pass anyway. We seem to be targeting immigrants with the legislation. I'm pretty sure that we should be targeting ""Legal"" Americans who do not seem to be complying with the laws regarding employment of illegal immigrants. Perhaps if there wasn't an established precedent among immigrants, that they could easily enter the country and obtain employment without obtaining all of the proper documantation, and permission, then maybe they wouldn't be so quick to skip the legal process.\nI don't know what the answers are. All I know is that most Americans are of immigrant heritage. The country was built on the premise that all oppressed persons could live freely in America. The melting pot. The world police. We are the folks who want to make a quick buck, and don't seem to have a problem paying illegal immigrants under the table to do do jobs that we Americans, (special breed of priveleged humans that we are) will not do. A large portion of our population would sooner take doantaions from church groups, or take welfare, and food stamps from the goverment than lower themselves by digging ditches, or cleaning toilettes, because we didn't bother to take the free education that we are entitled to, or take the extra time and effort to earn the degrees that would land us a profitable position doing an ""honorable job"". A large portion of folks coming from other countries do not have the same opportunities to turn down jobs and opt to not have a work ethic. A lot of people from other countries come here under horrid conditions for the opportunity to work under horrid conditions for pay that we Americans would not accept even if we were instead working in an air conditioned department store sipping $3 cups of coffee. It seems to me that immigrants desire to provide a better life for their families, while we would like to secure an X-Box 360 or an Ipod for ours. We desire the bling bling of a cool new car, and designer clothes. \nI could be wrong, but it seems to me that we need willing immigrants in order to have all of the things that we want with as little effort as we seem to be able to exert. If that's the case then I don't suppose that we ought to continue the hypocritical banter about sending them back to where they came from, etc. If we ever do actually get to a point where we want to do all of our own work then I guess we'd better crack down on the folks who employ people illegally, rather than deny children of immigrants an education, or arrest church groups for providing help to immigrants. \nI'm afraid that I don't agree with ""the immigration law"" as it does not address the real issues.\nI think that ""the immigration law"" is receiving a lot of media hype at the moment because we're nearing an election year."

Florida has beaten three teams that were ranked during the season, lost to one, and is scheduled to play another. They beat FSU, which is having an offseason by their standards by 7 points.

5244,"Because the product keys are encrypted, you cannot simply go into the registry and retrieve it like you could in earlier versions of Windows. You will need a utility program to extract the product id from your registry. One such tool is the Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder. Another is the Belarc Advisor. I am certain there are others on the market as well but we will focus on the use of these two for the purposes of this article.\n\n    * The Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder is a freeware utility that retrieves your Product Key (CD key) used to install Windows or Office from your registry. It has the options to copy the key to clipboard, save it to a text file, or print it for safekeeping. It works on Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Office 97 and Office XP. Unfortunately, it does not appear to support Office 2000.\n\n      The Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder is amazingly simple to use. The file itself, keyfinder.exe, is small—only 257 KB. There is no installation program. Just run the program, either from the command line or by double-clicking it from the folder you downloaded it to. When you do, your product key will appear as shown. (I changed my product key in this image for security reasons.)\n    * The Belarc Advisor is a freeware utility that builds a detailed profile of your installed software and hardware and then displays the results in your Web browser. None of this information is sent to the internet. It is all stored privately on your computer.\n\n      The information displayed includes, but is not limited to:\n         1. Operating System type and build\n         2. Motherboard brand and serial number\n         3. Installed drives, CD and fixed, including brand and capacity\n         4. Installed Microsoft hotfixes\n         5. Installed Microsoft software licenses and some keys\n         6. List of all installed software \n\nNOTE: It should be noted that I have received at least one report of the Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder returning an incorrect key. I have never had that happen to me and I have used it many time to recover keys from the registries of clients computers. The Belarc Advisor does have this footnote on its results page regarding Windows keys: ""This may be the manufacturer's factory installed product key rather than yours."" I believe this may be the cause of the MJB error as well.\n\nThat’s all there is to it. Once you recover the key, write down the number and then you can reinstall your software, or place the it in a database where you won’t lose it.\n\nEDIT: 10:38AM, March 10, 2006\n\nYou may want to try Insaneware Keyfinder:\n\nhttp://www.insaneware.com/"

5257,"I would have to say, that despite the more advanced level of play, or perhaps because of it, college sports are better than professional sports. Three main reasons:\n\n1. Those athletes out there are playing for the love of the game, not for money, not for agents, not for Hummers and publicity, they're playing because that is what they love to do. And at most schools, they're doing it while juggling classwork as well. Throw money in and things get all hairy. As the Bible says, ""love of money is the root of all evil"".\n\n2. The sheer pageantry of collegiate athletics, most especially football. The century-old rivalries, the mascots, the fight songs, the student sections, the bands, all of these are missing in pro sports. As a sort of cheap replacement are these fake cheerleaders who are in no way considered a part of the game. Don't get me wrong, there are some solid pro rivalries, Vikings-Packers, Chiefs-Raiders, but they just lack that extra atmosphere that collegiate rivalries pack. \n\n3. Upsets. Upsets happen in professional sports, but think about it, if the 0-10 Raiders beat the 8-2 Patriots, it's not that big of a deal. The Patriots will still make the playoffs, nobody really worries that much. But if Texas loses to Baylor, stop the presses. That is essentially a season-ending loss, the kind that destroys any chance UT might have had for winning a national championship. Pro football and the other sports are great, but who can argue that there was a regular season NFL game as exciting as USC-Notre Dame? OSU-Texas? Fun to watch, but due to the (admitedly, rather imperfect) system, they don't carry nearly as much weight as these college games.\n\nI know I used football for my examples a lot, but that's largely because I think the NFL is the best professional league, both in terms of how much I enjoy watching it, and how the league is organized and run. And it's the best sport overall."
5258,"As soon as we let them.\n\nWinston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\n\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\n\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered."

He is currently considered one of Germany's most talented defenders.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metzelder signed for Borussia, and he was an instant success. He not only won the German championships with BVB in 2002 as a regular first team player, he also reached the 2002 World Cup final with Germany. In the tournament, he was also voted the ""Best Player Under The Age of 23"". But despite offers from other big clubs, he extended his contract until 2005. After his long injury lay-off, fans and team-mates are now both hoping that Metzelder will be able to make a comeback next season that mirrored the start of his career four years ago.\n\nOne can hardly fail to notice the main strength of the BVB skipper: With a height of 1.94 metres, Metzelder is outstanding in the air. And despite his young age, the centre back, who can also play on the right of defence, has nerves of steel and necessary combination of composure and confidence. This, along with his superb tackling skills, both in the air and on the ground, make Metzelder a very good defensive player.\n\nProfile\nDate of birth: 05.11.1980 \nPlace of Birth: Haltern \nSign of the zodiac: Scorpio \nNation: Germany \nHeight: 194 cm \nWeight: 84 kg \nNumber: 21 \nPosition: Defender \n\nHonours\nGerman Champion 2002 \n2002 World Cup Runner Up \n\nClubs\nBorussia Dortmund \nPreußen Münster \nFC Schalke 04 \nTuS Haltern"

He seemed like a regular guy, in contrast to that over-practiced, slick style of Gore in the 2000 Presidential race.  I think that's why Gore lost to the underdog, Bush.  I think it's the simplest explanation for Bush's victory, since there was no way to judge his fitness for leadership, other than his governorship in Texas, which most Americans knew nothing about."

5354,Ryan G makes a very good point when using a telescoping fishing rod. It's very easy to get your line wrapped around the rod unintentionally.\nOther than that you should check to see that your line is wound properly onto the spool and not tangled onto interior working parts. This happens often on spin-cast reels that are spooled with too much line.\nWhen reeling in your line keep a slight pressure on it by holding it between your fingers. It helps the line to spool evenly and helps detect light bites.\n\nBest of luck.

5382,"Oboe is an instrument that takes a while to build up good tone. It isnt an instrument like clarinet or saxophone in which good tone tends to come quicker.  You just need patience! Keep practicing. Listen to recordings of other oboists and find things in their sound that you like and try to imitate them or keep their sound in mind while you practice. Some good people to listen to are Alex Klein, John Mack, Mark Weiger (he is my oboe teacher! has a couple cds out, VERY VERY GOOD) and Allen Vogel just to name a few!\nAlso, if you arent currently taking private lessons, look for an teacher! A good place to look is in the music department of a local college. Chances are there will be a couple oboe majors looking for students! Good luck and keep up the good work!\n\n**Edit**\nThe comment about sax and clarinet tone being easier is a fact. The first sound out of one of those instruments is a lot prettier than the first sounds out of an oboe. I have numerous years of experience on sax and clarinet so I know. In reference to dropping your jaw, it depends on how your embouchure is. That doesnt always work for everyone. Dropping your jaw will help if you have a very pinched sound or if your pitch is on the sharp side. Rounded out your embouchure will help give you a fuller sound if you bite too much. Other people's embouchures tend to be too loose though and causes the sound to be very thin and airy. Your best bet is to just get a private teacher and see what they say! It's hard to make embochure adjustments without seeing the player or hearing them."

If you can't get into windows itself, you'll have to go through DOS itself.  Use a boot disk and get into dos.  Run chkdsk to make sure your file system is not corrupted and possibly try a defrag.

If you are good at it, you will very much likely succeed in getting high scores and in law school and the bar exam later on. My mentor who sat on the bar review commission told me there's a strikingly high correlation between the LSAT score, and the law school performance and the bar exam.  \n\nHaving said that, if you are not good at it, the best you can do is to learn how to approach the standard exams. And I want to remind you that being a poor standard exam taker is not insurmountable to overcome this.  However, you have to know how and follow exactly what I tell you here.  Here is how: The most important thing is when you practice by solving the problems, make sure you always time them.  The next important thing is once again, time them.  Next thing you have to worry about is .... you got the idea by now -- time them!!!!\n\nRemember also it is a game that most of us have the ability to do well.  But I have seen way too many people caught up with notion that you have to get all the questions right.  You should have no problem solving about a half of the problems correctly before you begin practicing them."

That's an example of a past flaw, but now, we have problems with corruption, just like any other government.  Most flaws lie in the setup of the voting.  Technically the people do not select the president, that is done through the electoral college, which was created because the formers of the Constitution believed that the people of the United States were too stupid to elect the president themselves.  \nAnother flaw with the voting is the fact that Congress passes laws affecting people who are not represented.

5562,"Illegal immigrants, themselves, brought this issue to the forefront when they marched and protested and demanded rights and waved their flags in our streets last May.  THEY BROUGHT THEMSELVES to the attention of the citizens of the USA!  Suddenly, people started noticing the closure of hospitals due to being inundated with illegal immigrants who do NOT pay for their medical treatment.  Suddenly, people started looking around and seeing the devastation of their towns and neighbourhoods with illegal immigrants over-housing residences and overburdening schools and causing the education of their own children to be degraded and their neighborhoods to become unsafe and squalid due to over-housing - 10 or more people in a residence meant for a family of 4?  This causes safety hazards for purposes of fire and overburdens the sewer systems, garbage removal, parking on the streets, and lowers the property values of the homes in the neighborhoods, etc.  Suddenly, people realized that the reason they weren't able to find work in occupations they used to be able to earn a decent living in, such as construction and manufacturing, etc. was because of illegal immigrants who were willing to work for far less and usually ""under the table"" for cash, which illegal immigrants are willing to do because then they don't pay taxes on their income.  An American cannot work for that cheap, because they DO have to pay income taxes!  \n\nThis is a hot issue right now because of the huge number of illegal immigrants in the country now and the fact that they are pouring in at greater and greater numbers daily.  Previously, mostly only border states and towns were more aware of the illegal immigrants, but now they are starting to move further north and more and more states and towns are finding themselves negatively affected to a level that they can no longer turn a blind eye to it.  Illegal immigration is DEVASTATING our great country and the time has come to put a stop to it, however we have to do it.  The citizens of the USA have had ENOUGH and are no longer able to support the poorest of the poor from all the other countries of the world because we are needing to look after our own poor, first."

This stems from their feelings of abandonment by family and friends, the inability to do for themselves and an overall feeling of inadequacy.\n\nAs a supervisor, I have been the target of this 'anger' many times, but have learned to let it roll off my back. I also have learned to make sure I do not put myself in a compromising position where a resident can accuse me of any kind of abuse.\n\nIf you are being FALSELY accused of abuse by a resident, the first thing you should do is sit down with your supervisor and clear the air. Ask that you be placed on another unit (if possible) away from that resident for a while.\n\nAs far as taking him to court?.... don't go there. You won't win ANYTHING, and you will be pegged as a troublemaker.\n\n\nFinally, monitor your tone and demeanor when addressing residents in the future.

If so, I think you would be better off taking the money you would spend on OS X and putting it toward a new iMac.  (Or if you can find a monitor somwhere, a Mac Mini, which is even cheaper.)  If it is a later generation iMac, then you will see a big difference with OS X, assuming you have plenty of RAM--at least 512 K.  But I would not spend the money ($129) on the latest version of the OS, which is 10.4.  You can pick up v. 10.3 for less than half that, if you look at eBay and similar sites.  If you decide to go this route, make sure that your buy a copy that is good for all Macs (not the ones that are given with a particular model).  That way you know it will install on your iMac.  Also, if you install 10.3, go to the Apple Web site and download the free upgrades to take it to 10.3.9.\n\nI am writing this on a second-generation G3 iMac, one step newer than the Bondi version, and I am using 10.3.9 But if you can afford it, my main advice is to spend the money on a new computer if your iMac is old.

What Saddam did to the Kurds will be childs play if the US walks away now. Then who will share the responsibility of having the blood of the Kurds on their hands.

5703,"For other uses, see PHP (disambiguation).\n  PHP\n \nMaintainer: The PHP Group \nLatest release: 5.1.4 / May 4, 2006\n4.4.2 / January 13, 2006 \nOS: Cross-platform \nUse: Scripting language \nLicence: PHP License 3.01 \nWebsite: www.php.net \nPHP is a scripted programming language that can be used to create websites. Short for ""PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"" (the initials actually come from the earliest version of the program, which was called ""Personal Home Page"" but in their current form, constitute a recursive acronym), it is an open-source, reflective programming language used mainly for developing server-side applications and dynamic web content, and more recently, a broader range of software applications. For example, MediaWiki, the software behind Wikipedia, is written in PHP.\n\nPHP allows interaction with a large number of relational database management systems, such as MySQL, Oracle, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Firebird and SQLite. PHP runs on most major operating systems, including Unix, Linux, Netware, Windows, and Mac OS X, and can interact with many major web servers.\n\nPHP provides a command line interface (CLI), as well as GUI libraries such as the Gimp Tool Kit (GTK+) and text mode libraries like Ncurses and Newt.\n\nPHP is the result of the efforts of many contributors. It is licensed under the PHP License, a BSD-style license. Since version 4, it has been powered by the Zend engine.\n\nPHP was originally designed as a small set of Perl scripts, followed by a rewritten set of CGI binaries written in C by the Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 to display his résumé and to collect certain data, such as how much traffic his page was receiving. ""Personal Home Page Tools"" was publicly released on 8 June 1995 after Lerdorf combined it with his own Form Interpreter to create PHP/FI.\n\nZeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two Israeli developers of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to the recursive acronym ""PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"". The development team officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997 after months of beta testing. Public testing of PHP 3 began immediately and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend engine in 1999 (a page at www.zend.com states that PHP 3 was powered by Zend Engine 0.5). They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel which has since overseen the PHP advances.\n\nIn May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released.\n\nOn July 13, 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by Zend Engine II. PHP 5 includes new features such as PHP Data Objects (PDO) and more performance enhancements taking advantage of the new engine."

5756,"Actually NAS is better known as Network Attached Storage. I currently use a 160GB Buffalo LinkStation and found it extremely easy to configure and use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe LinkStation is a network-attached storage device, but it also includes a print server, attachable via one of its two USB ports, and it creates a shared folder for use by anyone on your network. You can use the other USB port to attach an additional drive, but you have to format it with the LinkStation first.\n\nDisk performance is limited by the network. 100 megabits per second (which is only a quarter of the raw capability of USB 2.0) so almost all of the other devices that I looked at outperformed the LinkStation handily. But the convenience of having disk storage available to all of your PCs makes the slower speed bearable. Buffalo does not currently provide centralized backup software for the LinkStation, but I had no problem scheduling and initiating backups from individual PCs using Windows Backup. The network connection was more than adequate for streaming music, even to multiple PCs.\n\nI referenced the following sites when I was trying to make my choice\n\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,1874,677853,00.asp\nhttp://reviews-zdnet.com.com/Buffalo_LinkStation_120GB/4505-3382_16-30639593.html\nhttp://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-207-ProdID-HDHG250LAN.php"

I thought that is was a good idea to sign up because you go at your own pace.  so I researched it a little bit and their website looked legit and they said they were accredited.  So I sent them a check for 5 dollars and they said they would get me started and I would make payments to them every month. After I gave them my check, they asked if they could record my voice saying that I want to join the school.  So I did.  Well, they send me my first semester's materials, and they are like middle school literature.  And they even have books that look like they were photocopied.  So in reading the material, it says that if you don't send them your first exams in a certain amount of time, they will drop you from the school, so I didn't send anything to them for a few months because during this time, I found that they are accredited but the president of their board that does the accredidation, is the president of the school.  They accredited themselves.  Also, there is a difference between regionally accredited and nationally accredited.  I found out that after I had already given them the 5 dollars, that most colleges would not let me transfer credits from ashworth.  Most of the colleges had never even heard of ashworth.  Now Ashworth college is trying to come after me for 9 thousand dollars for the whole semester!! When speaking to others, I was told that this one person did an aerial view of the address and all that was there was a warehouse.

5801,"Are you wanting to become a veterinary technician OR an assistant?  There is a HUGE difference.  The veterinary technician program Penn-Foster IS accredited by the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association), which means that if you successfully completed the program with Penn-Foster, you could sit for the VTNE (Veterinary Technician National Exam) and a state board exam if your state offers it.  HOWEVER - I have spoken to several veterinarians that do not take degrees from these online courses as seriously, even if the person passed the board exams.  It is too easy for people to cheat on tests since most tests are taken at home, and you also do not get the quality of clinical laboratory experience that you'd get in a traditional classroom setting.  Also, many traditional programs for veterinary technicians and assistants require hands-on care of resident teaching animals.  And if you're in an online program, you don't get that extra experience of caring for the animals.  For those reasons, many veterinarians pass over vet tech / assistant applicants that have a degree from online schools.  NOT ALL of course, but many vets do feel this way."

They got rid of Tice, who seemed to want to be everyone's buddy instead of their coach, and got Childress, who seems to run a tight ship (no pun intended) (OK, maybe a little pun intended). They got rid of Culpepper, who proved the critics correct last season that he could not play without Moss. Yeah, the front line was not great (they kind of sucked), but Johnson was able to adapt to it, and if Culpepper was as high caliber QB as he thinks he is, he should have adapted also. Speaking of the front line, Hutchinson will really improve the line, and with Birk coming back this season, and the addition of Taylor as running back, their running game (hopefully) will be vastly improved.\n\nOne area that will hurt them is the loss of Burleson. But they still have some pretty good receivers. I think KRob may get the starting job. He started as kick-off returns last season, but step up as one of the go-to guys when Johnson took over. If they draft a receiver with one of their 2nd round picks, they should be OK in that department. And defense is an area that has really plagued them for the last few years. Now, with a new defensive scheme, it may take half the year (hopefully not longer) for the players to adapt. The area they really need help is linebackers. But, if they can at least play to the level they did at the second half of last season, and with the improvements to the offense, they may have a shot this year. But, I've been a Vikings fan long enough to know not to hold my breath over it."

McClellan, a rising military star in Ohio, proposed an overall strategy for the war directly to President Abraham Lincoln, one that emphasized the part his army could play. Scott, the general-in-chief of the U.S. Army, wrote a letter to McClellan on May 3, 1861, stating in part:\n\nIt is the design of the Government to raise 25,000 additional regular troops, and 60,000 volunteers, for three years. ... We rely greatly on the sure operation of a complete blockade of the Atlantic and Gulf ports soon to commence. In connection with such blockade, we propose a powerful movement down the Mississippi to the ocean, with a cordon of posts at proper points ... the object being to clear out and keep open this great line of communication in connection with the strict blockade of the seaboard, so as to envelop the insurgent States and bring them to terms with less bloodshed than by any other plan.[1]\n\nScott went on to warn against hot-headed demands for a march on the Confederate capital, Richmond.\n\nScott's plan involved two main parts.\n\nBlockade the coast of the South to prevent the export of cotton, tobacco, and other cash crops from the South and to keep them from importing much-needed war supplies. \nDivide the South by controlling the Mississippi River to cut off the southeastern states from the western. Scott considered this an ""envelopment"" rather than an ""invasion"", although it would require armies and fleets of river gunboats to accomplish it. \nHis proposal received considerable public criticism at the time. A famous newspaper cartoon depicted a huge snake squeezing the Confederacy, thus giving the plan its popular name. The United States government never formally adopted it, but President Lincoln did implement the two parts. However, he ignored Scott's warning against direct invasion, and used far more troops (nearly two million), trying repeatedly to capture Richmond.\n\nLincoln called for a blockade of the South on April 19, 1861, six days after the fall of Fort Sumter (and a few weeks before Scott's letter). The blockade itself, thought to be an impossible task against 3,000 miles of highly irregular coastline, was an unparalleled success within the first six months, and nearly impregnable within the first two years. The blockade accounted for the vast increase in the price of cotton abroad and the extreme scarcity of manufactured goods in the South by the end of the war, contributing to the South's defeat. It was the most successful naval blockade to date, and the first"

Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane. While Captain Rich and Air Marshal Gene Carson don't want to doubt Kyle's insistent claim that her daughter has vanished, all evidence points to the fact that Kyle's little girl was never on board. What is the truth behind Kyle Pratt's distress? Who on board can be trusted? And just how far will Kyle have to go to get to the bottom of the harrowing mystery? As paranoia and doubt mount among the passengers, Kyle is confronted with some of the most unsettling fears a mother could ever face--losing her child, having her very reality questioned and being trapped in a situation where no one can seem to help. Pushed to the edge and fighting for her sanity, Kyle finds herself willing to go to unimaginable lengths to save her daughter.\n\nStarring:   Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Sean Bean, Kate Beahan, Michael Irby"

5949,"BLACK FRIDAY (SHOPPING) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_Sale\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, is historically one of the busiest retail shopping days of the year. Many consider it the ""official"" beginning to the holiday season. Most retailers will open very early and usually provide massive discounts on their products.\n\nAlthough Black Friday is typically the busiest shopping day of the year in terms of customer traffic, it is not typically the day with the highest sales volume. That is usually either Christmas Eve or the last Saturday before Christmas.\n\nOrigin\n\nThe first use of this term to describe the day after Thanksgiving is not exactly known. There are two popular theories as to its origin.\n\nAccounting practice\n\nOne theory is that stores traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season. When this would be recorded in the financial records, common accounting practices use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink would show positive amounts. Black Friday is the beginning of the period where they would no longer have losses (the red) and instead take in the year's profits (the black).\n\nStress from large crowds\n\nAnother theory comes from the fact that shopping experience on this day can be extremely stressful. The term is used as a comparison to the extremely stressful and chaotic experience of Black Thursday or other black days. According to The Word Spy:\n\nEarliest Citation:\nChristmas decorations around Tampa Bay started going up in late October, and business has been brisk since then. And while Friday--known as Black Friday for the legendary hordes--will be the biggest shopping day for many area stores, others ring up the greatest sales the Saturday before Christmas.\n—Marilyn Marks, ""Retailers expect good sales this Christmas,"" St. Petersburg Times, November 27, 1986\n\nThere exists an earlier reference, speaking to the Friday after Thanksgiving:\n\nA BLACK FRIDAY.\nThere have been many Black Fridays in recent history. Most of them have been days of financial panic. There has been none of blacker foreboding than last Friday. And the blackness is not loss or fear of loss in stocks and bonds.\nNew York Times (1857-Current file).\nNew York, N.Y.: Dec 3, 1922. pg. 38, 1 pgs\nISSN/ISBN 03624331\n\nEmployees of retail stores have for years referred to Black Friday in a satirical way, to note the extremely stressful and hectic nature of the day. Heavy traffic and customer demands added to the long hours make it a difficult day.\n\n\nBlack Friday on the Internet\n\nAdvertisements in advance\n\nCertain websites such as DealTaker.com offer information about Black Friday deals up to a month in advance. The text listings of prices are usually accompanied by adscans -- complete PDFs either leaked by insiders, or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nCyber Monday\n\nThe term Cyber Monday refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday, which unofficially marks the beginning of the holiday online shopping season.\n\nIn recent years, Cyber Monday has become a busy day for online retailers, with some sites offering low prices and other promotions on that day.\n\nControversy\n\nResponse (Buy Nothing Day)\n\nAnti-consumer frenzy protesters have chosen this day as Buy Nothing Day in North America, where those concerned about the increasing power and influence of consumer corporations are urged to not make consumer purchases.\n\nDMCA\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including Wal-Mart, Target Corporation, Best Buy, and Staples, Inc.) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisement are intellectual property and protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\nUsing the t"

Guess not anyway I got there about 10 min late then got lost going to the testing site. I forgot some of my paperwork in the car which they would not let me get. I then proceeded to fill out their paperwork. It was about 11:30 by the time i started the exam and it was timed. I didn't think I passed because I know I didn't actually finish but was unsure of the question number I got too.... I PASSED!! So don't do all of that and breathe before the test you'll be fine YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW!!.. Don't cram the night before you take the exam... It will stress you out and the information will not leak in... I am confident that you will pass all of your own expectations and pass with flying colors...\nAlso I suggest you attend a couple of your local open houses.

Know what a lein is and how a person can get one. Supply, and demand, etc.. good luck you'll do fine as my sponsoring broker says ""its not rocket science, just do it"" Good luck with your future career.

I don't think they will pull off a sweep like the Republicans did in 1994. I'm still amazed that happened.\n\nOr Will The Republican Party Still Retain Control?\n\nThis would be my guess. Republicans don't lose either House of Senate. Off year elections are about state races. Do you like your person or not. President's popularity has little effect.\n\nIf, you think the Democrats will win control of 1 chamber, which 1 is it going to be? The Senate or The House? \n\nIF the Democrats win one house it will be The House. There all 435 seats are up for re-election. In the Senate there are only 33 maybe 34 seats up for re-election. Democrats would have to win a greater percentage of the races in order to retake the Senate.\n\nNancy Pelosi Speaker of the House..\nHarry Reid Senate Majority Leader..\nDoes it have a nice ring to it?\n\nI'm a moderate. I'm not rabid for either side. Harry whould be OK if he goes a little less combative. Nancy? The thought of her really being in charge of anything of importance makes me nauseous.\n\nRemember I'm one of those people who really determine who's running this country. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. In 1994 the Democrats got kicked out because the swing voters were tired of what the liberals were pushing AND what the Republicans were advocating seemed like a good alternative.\n\nUs swingers may be tired of what the Republicans are pushing, but Democrats aren't offering anything as an alternative but 'We aren't Republicans'. That doesn't resonate with me. Talk to me. Tell me what you really want to do and how you plan to pay for it. \n\nThat how you plan to pay for it is the most important part of what I want to know. Especialy since Democrats have gotten on the 'We're spending too much' bandwagon lately.\n\nCongress IS there for the taking. But if you want my vote I'm going to have to like what I'm hearing. And if all I'm hearing is the Republicans are wrong. That may be true but if Democrats don't tell me how they are going to do differently, how do I know they won't be worse?"

6011,"You cannot patent or copyright a name, you trademark a name.  A ""trademark"" is a word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce to identify and distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from goods manufactured or sold by others.\n\nEvery state issues their own trademarks, but getting a state trademark is virtually useless. The federal registration will for all intents and purposes trump any state registration. For example, if you get a trademark in Florida and use the mark in commerce only in Orlando, Florida, and subsequently another party files for a federal registration on the same mark, you are estopped from using your mark outside of Orlando! Moreover, a state registration does not even entitle you to rights throughout the entire state. Notice in the previous example that I said that if someone were to obtain a federal registration on the same mark for which you had a Florida state registration you would only be able to use the mark in your geographic area, not throughout the state. So if you use the mark in commerce in Orlando, Florida, and someone acquires a federal registration, they can use the mark in Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, etc. The important concept here is that while a state registration is usually much cheaper than a federal registration, state registration provides little or no significant rights.\n\nFinally, in terms of copyright protection for an insurance product, that is likely not the best form of protection.  A copyright only protects expression, not function.  Patents, on the other hand, protect function.  If your insurance product is new and non-obvious you could receive a patent on it, likely a business method patent.  It is wise to seek copyright protection though, because it is so cheap.\n\nIn terms of how long it will take to obtain a patent or trademark, US patents for business methods could easily take 3 to 4 years from the date you file an application.  Trademarks, however, are much quicker.  Normally you would expect the whole process of obtaining a federal trademark in the US to take about 14 months."

6024,"I can answer this from the point of view of a hiring (recruitment) manager.\n\nIf I don't get back to a candidate ASAP, it either means:\n\n1. I'm extremely busy and there are too many work-related emergencies to deal with at the moment. A manager who uses this as an excuse generally is a new or poorly trained manager. Such a manager can easily become overwhelmed with a large number of tasks and can accidentally let important but not critically urgent tasks slip.\n\n2. There is another candidate that I'm interested in, and you're my back-up choice. I'm stalling for time so I can interview & get my first choice to accept the position. A manager who does this generally lacks integrity and probably won't treat his/her employees with much respect.\n\n3. There's a personal emergency that I suddenly had to deal with and had to leave the office. In this case, hopefully the manager has alerted his/her supervisor about his/her remaining open items and has made plans to get them covered. That doesn't always happen though, depending on the severity of the emergency.\n\n4. There's some kind of red tape that's delaying this process. Perhaps another department that is taking care of the logistics of your employment. In some large companies, HR takes care of start dates and other related issues (though that's rare). Or perhaps HR still needs to complete some tasks (like a background check, compensation issues, etc). Or perhaps the hiring manager needs his/her direct supervisor's approval before moving forward, and the bottleneck is with the supervisor. Delays due to red tape in large companies are unfortunately common.\n\nHere's what you can do in each of these situations:\n\n1. Call the hiring manager and if he/she's not there, leave a voice mail saying that you'll call back again. Make the effort yourself to keep calling until you reach him/her on the phone. You don't have to leave a message each time, but some managers dont/aren't able to respond to voice mails immediately, so getting the person on the phone directly is the best way. Also send the hiring manager a follow-up email.\n\n2. Do the same as #1. Chances are, the hiring manager will avoid returning your calls because he/she wants to keep you around as a back-up choice, and if he/she tells you about another candidate, you'll go away. But you should still get in touch with the hiring manager on the phone anyways.\n\n3. If you've been in contact with an HR representative or the hiring manager's direct supervisor, call that contact as well. Sometimes a third party can help get things going again.\n\n4. Do the same as #1. Ask the hiring manager if there's anything you can do to help the process. Perhaps he/she will tell you about the red tape and apologize for it; that would be good because you'd know the reason for the delay.\n\n\nI assume you've already received a written offer letter - if not, and the good news came verbally, than you really need to get this offer in writing. Without that, then there's a good chance the delay could be due to #4 and the hiring manager simply is trying to get that offer letter out to you.\n\nThere was once an actual case where it took me, my HR department, and my finance department nearly 2 weeks to get an offer letter out, due to various logistical issues & general red tape. However, in that situation, I was in constant contact with the candidate to let him know the reason for the delay.\n\nI hope that helps. Good luck!"

Even if you've closed all programs there are still processes running in the background in Windows.  Doing the Shut Down procedure in Windows is the preferred way because it stops everything and then turns it off.  Now sometimes it's not avoidable such as during a lockup but that's the only time I would suggest doing that.  Over many times of shutting the machine off improperly you will get system errors.

6056,"An attachment to an electronic message used for security purposes. The most common use of a digital certificate is to verify that a user sending a message is who he or she claims to be, and to provide the receiver with the means to encode a reply.\n\nAn individual wishing to send an encrypted message applies for a digital certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA issues an encrypted digital certificate containing the applicant's public key and a variety of other identification information. The CA makes its own public key readily available through print publicity or perhaps on the Internet.\n\nThe recipient of an encrypted message uses the CA's public key to decode the digital certificate attached to the message, verifies it as issued by the CA and then obtains the sender's public key and identification information held within the certificate. With this information, the recipient can send an encrypted reply.\n\nThe most widely used standard for digital certificates is X.509. \n\nFor further information just refer this link :\n\nhttp://www.verisign.com.au/repository/tutorial/digital/intro1.shtml"
6057,"Bound's hubby here:\n\nAs you are aware the front post on the M14 is fixed. The left knob on the rear sight is your elevation and the right knob is your windage. \n\nOn the rear sight base, center the windage index marks with the receiver base. With your elevation knob, run the rear sight all the way down (twist the knob forward). Do not pay attention to the elevation calibrations on the elevation knob, 110% of the time they do not match. Now, raise the rear sight four clicks. The rule of thumb with the M14/M1A is that 4-6 clicks of elevation will put you on paper at 200 yards. \n\nThe elevation drum with the calibrations is typically calibrated for use with military M118 ammo (173 gr. FMJBT-full metal jacket boat tail). \n\nYour rifle will shoot best using either 150 gr. FMJ, 168 gr. HPBT, 173 gr. FMJBT, or 175 gr. HPBT bullets. You can adjust the index wheel, but what alot of shooters do is mark their zero with nail polish, it's alot easier. \n\nZeroing a rifle with the 25m target (1000 inch target) is generally reserved for use with the M16/AR15 because of the raised sight line.\n\nGood luck."

Every other news channel, and even those who are not news channels, had given the election to Bush.  It was all about Ohio, remember.  According to the results that were in, even if the rest of the people in Ohio who were eligible to still vote, voted for Kerry, it would still not be enough to take the lead.

They will give you directions as to the amount and what to put in. Tell them it's newly filled and what type of sanitizer you will be using.They will give you stabilizer, shock and sanitizer at the very least. Follow their directions as to what and how much  to add. While you are there, ask if they have a pool care guide you can have. Some chemical manufactureres distibute these with their products. It shouldn't cost you anything.\n As a general rule the only chemical added to a pool that requires a wait time, is chlorine shock. It's always a good idea to shock at dusk. Two reasons: 1/ More bang for your buck as ultra violet light doesn't break down the shock until morning. 2/ The kids are done swimming for the day and no one will be using the pool.\n If you must shock during the day, wait at least 4 hours on a sunny day, before jumping in again."

6161,"Cheap and illegal labor are a crutch American businesses need to ween themselves off of and what better time than now? If illegal immigrants stopped doing these jobs companies would be forced to pay decent wages (with benefits) to American citizens. The hiring of cheap, illegal labor hurts us all by lowering wages across the board, making benefits less common and by lowering the amount of taxes that go back into the economy not to mention the drain on government and social services. Yes, we might have to pay a little more for our oranges or our chickens or to have our lawns mowed but so what, it's worth it to all of us in the long run. I propose a boycott against companies that rely on cheap, illegal labor that hurts us all. \n\nI think the argument that illegals only take jobs that Americans don't want is a complete falsehood. I know there are lots of Americans who are out of work and would be happy to take jobs on farms, in hotels, in factories or plants if they offered decent wages and benefits again. The fact is companies that rely on cheap, illegal labor don't have to offer good wages to anyone, or benefits either. I remember when the janitor at my grade school could still afford to own a house, put food on the table and send his kids to college. Do you think that could happen now? I doubt it. So how about we make every day a boycott day!"

I would suggest looking at a plan that has a deductible that is at least $1,500 for a single person or $3,000 for a family.  This will keep the premium costs lower and also qualify you for contributions into an HSA (Health Savings Account).  These contributions are pre-tax and can be withdrawn and used tax free for qualified medical expenses.  \nThis type of strategy saves you premium costs and taxes.  If you or a family member who will be on the plan has a large amount of health care expenses per year, you might do better to consider a lower deductible.  The increased premiums might be less expensive than the out of pocket expenses if you are more likely to use more services or ongoing prescription medications that are expensive."

So, it goes back and forth and will continue to do so, as long as man thinks for himself and is not exactly like every other man.\n\nPersonally, the basic concept behind the 10 commandments- the message they convey- really isn't all that controversial.  All those things are covered by our laws, so what's the big deal about putting them in writing and posting them in your schools and courthouse....  Well, there wouldn't be any problem with it, if it didn't come from a religious text.  If it was written in a law book or our consitution, it would be accepted.

Phil must have made it abundantly clear that if Kobe didn't get the other players involved, they wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nAlso, seeing Steve Nash win MVP could have done two things to Kobe. It could have made him think that if Nash was considered, by the majority of the voters, to be more influential in making his team win, by passing as much or more than scoring, then maybe he would too. OR it's possible that the ultra-comptetive Kobe has come out to prove that he can play a more sharing, Nash-like game better than Nash can. Or maybe he's just trying to show he can play a more balanced game, to show that he should have been voted MVP. Or maybe this is part of his attempt to clean up his image. Maybe he's trying to overcome the stigma against him that he doesn't pass, and he's doing it on a national stage where everyone can witness it.\n\nMaybe he's learning to trust his teammates. Maybe his teammates are giving him more of a reason to trust them. \n\nThe Lakers are a franchise built around Kobe at this point. Late game, he is their go to guy. He is always put in a position to win the game at the end, bring them back, or keep the lead up in close situations. Maybe it's sinking in that it's his team, and he's not feeling as pressured to prove it is. Maybe he had enough big individual scoring games this year that he feels his talent can't be called into question if he doesn't score.\n\nWho knows. Just know that Kobe's competetiveness and ego are probably the driving factors in this change, since they seem to have driven the rest of his noticeable behavior so far. Since winning is how success is measured in the Playoffs, he could satisfy his ego and competetiveness more through winning than individual performance - although one could argue that his individual performance is more impressive now, despite the decline in scoring."

6334,"Délaissée à tord par bon nombre de pêcheurs, la pêche de la brème est passionnante de part la diversité des techniques qui sont misent en œuvre ainsi que la faculté d’adaptation que nécessite la réussite d’une bonne pêche.\n Selon les jours, au même endroit, les brèmes mordront mieux à la canne, au feeder, ou à la bolognaise, il faut donc employer la bonne technique, mais avant de savoir quel choix faire, il faut passer de nombreuses heures au bord de l’eau à se poser des questions qui pour certaines resteront sans réponses, mais c’est aussi cela le charme de la pêche. \nLa pêche de la brème en étang\nA la grande canne : \nPour pêcher à la grande canne, les meilleurs postes sont ceux où il y a un banc de nénuphars à proximité, une avancée ou un grand fond en bordure.\nCe sont des endroits qui sont toujours visités par les brèmes.\n La ligne sera constituée d’un corps de ligne en 10 ou 12/100, d’un flotteur de 0,40 à 1,5 g suivant la profondeur, et d’un bas de ligne en 8 ou 10/100 avec un hameçon n° 20 à 14 selon la taille des poissons et l’esche utilisée.\nLa forme du flotteur est très importante pour pêcher la brème en étang. Il est préférable d’utiliser des modèles de forme poire allongée qui permettent de bien visualiser les touches dites en « relevé » typiques de la brème, tout en offrant une bonne stabilité dans la vague s’il y a du vent.\n L’amorçage sera constitué de 8 à 10 boules d’amorce au départ, le rappel pouvant se faire avec l’amorce ou en frondant des asticots sur le coup quand les touches diminues.\nLa ligne devra être réglée de telle sorte que l’esche traîne sur le fond ou évolue entre deux eaux suivant la position des poissons dans la couche d’eau.\nEn effet, en étang, surtout lorsqu’il fait chaud, les brèmes ont tendance à décoller du fond et se tenir entre deux eaux.\nCeci est d’autant plus vrai lorsque l’on rappelle en frondant des asticots.\nLa pêche de la brème en rivière \nLa brème est souvent présente en forte densité dans les rivières et fleuves français et l’on peut y réaliser d’énormes bourriches.\nIl serait donc dommage de passer à coté de cette aubaine car c’est vraiment une pêche passionnante où l’on se mesure souvent à des poissons qui atteignent le kilo voir plus de deux sur certains secteurs.\nContrairement au plan d’eau, en rivière, les bancs de brèmes n’hésitent pas à s’approcher du bord, il n’est donc pas forcément utile de les pêcher à 30 m. du bord.  \nLa pêche à la grande canne : \n         La présence du courant oblige à utiliser des lignes plus lourdes et plus solides qu’en étang.\nLa ligne sera donc constituée d’un corps de ligne de 10 à 16/100, d’un flotteur d’une portance de 1 à plus de 20 g. et d’un bas de ligne de 10 à 14/100 d’une longueur de 20 à 30 cm. muni d’un hameçon n°18 à 12.\nLe flotteur sera de forme boule afin d’être plus stable dans le courant et de permettre de retenir la ligne, voir de la caler.\nLes nouveaux flotteurs plats sont d’ailleurs tout à fait adaptés à la pêche de la brème en rivière dès lors qu’il est indispensable de caler la ligne pour présenter une esche presque immobile sur le fond.\n L’amorçage sera lourd au départ, constitué de 10 à 20 boules d’amorce de la taille d’une orange. Dès que les touches commencent à diminuer, il est nécessaire de rappeler régulièrement pour maintenir les brèmes sur place.\nPour cela, il faut parfois rappeler avec une boule serrée à une main à chaque coulée, voir plus si la densité de poissons est très importante.\n La ligne devra être réglée de telle sorte que le bas de ligne traîne sur le fond.\nPour cela, il est préférable de choisir un poste où il n’y a pas trop d’accrocs, une coulée propre permettant de pouvoir traîner franchement et c’est souvent un plus pour sélectionner les plus beaux poissons.  \nOK ?"

6357,"Origine\nll y a 1300 ans, Daruma (fondateur du Bouddhisme Zen en Inde), aurait introduit le Bouddhisme en Chine, y intégrant des méthodes d'enseignement spirituelles et physiques. Ces techniques étaient si éprouvantes que certains disciples tombaient d'épuisement ! \nPour leur donner plus de force et d'endurance, il développa une technique d'entraînement plus progressive. Il en fit un livre, Ekkin-Kyo, qui peut être considéré comme le premier livre de karaté.\n\nL'entraînement physique, fortement marqué par les principes philosophiques de Daruma, était enseigné au temple Shaolin en 500 avant J.C.\nEn résumé, le karaté d'Okinawa est la synthèse de 2 techniques de combat :\n- La première, utilisée par les habitants d'Okinawa était simple et terriblement efficace, et surtout très proche de la réalité car elle était utilisée depuis des siècles lors de véritables combats. \n- La seconde, beaucoup plus élaborée et imprégnée d'éléments philosophiques était le produit d'une ancienne culture chinoise. \nCette double origine explique la dualité du Karaté : très violent et efficace, mais en même temps une discipline stricte et austère marquée par une philosophie non violente. \n\nL'une des rares personnes à maîtriser toutes les méthodes du karaté d'Okinawa, Maître Funakoshi a enseigné une discipline complète, synthèse de tous les styles d'Okinawa. \nCette méthode fut connue sous le nom de Shotokan (Shotokan signifie ""Maison de Shoto"", nom d'écrivain de Funakoshi qui fut aussi poète, ). De part la grande popularité de ce style au Japon, et plus tard dans le monde entier, Funakoshi est considéré comme le père du karaté shotokan moderne.\n\nNé en 1868, il a commencé à étudier le karaté à 11 ans et a été l'élève de deux grands maîtres de l'époque, Azato et Itosu. Il était si bon élève qu'on lui enseigna tous les styles de karaté d'Okinawa.\nPour lui, le mot ""karaté"" prit avec le temps une signification plus large et synthétisa toutes ces méthodes pour devenir le ""karaté-do"", la voie du karaté, ou la main vide.\n\nEn 1916, il fit une démonstration au Botokuden de Kyoto (sur la principale île du Japon) qui était à l'époque le centre officiel de tous les arts martiaux. Le 6 mars 1921, le Prince héritier (qui deviendra Empereur du Japon), visita Okinawa et demanda à Funakoshi de lui faire une démonstration. \nEn 1922, il voyagea jusqu'à Tokyo pour présenter le karaté lors de la première exposition nationale sportive, organisée par le ministère de l'éducation.\nDevant le succès de sa méthode, on lui demanda de rester au Japon, et il ne retourna jamais à Okinawa.\nPar la suite, son fils, Yoshitaka introduira des exercices de combat et adaptera la pratique du karaté à la tradition japonaise. \nLe Karaté est aujourd'hui probablement l'art martial le plus populaire au monde.\nContrairement au Judo et à l'Aïkido, le Karaté ne fut jamais l'oeuvre d'un seul homme,\nmais celle de plusieurs générations de maîtres et de disciples,\nà travers une multitude d'écoles et de styles originaux qui conservent, aujourd'hui encore,\ntoutes leurs caractéristiques spécifiques.  \n \n Le karaté est un art qui cultive le courage et permet de développer la santé physique et mentale. De plus, grâce à l'entraînement de karaté, une personne peut se défendre contre une agression physique sans utiliser d'arme.\nToutefois, on peut également utiliser selon les circonstances certains outils ou instruments pour se défendre.\nLes gens voient souvent des techniques de casse de planches ou bris de tuiles avec le poing nu, et ceci fait qu'ils se méprennent sur le vrai but de l'entraînement de karaté. En fait ces techniques sont des techniques mineures.\nDe même que tout autre art martial, l'essence de l&#39"

In more expensive restaurants, where the prices of food are higher, tips will be greater although there may be lower turnover of tables. And good servers make more money that poor servers.

Medicinal chemistry involves the identification, synthesis and development of new chemical entities suitable for therapeutic use. It also includes the study of existing drugs, their biological properties, and their quantitative structure-activity relationships. \nOrganic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and reactions of organic compounds. \nPhysical chemistry is the study of the physical fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry,quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and spectroscopy. Physical chemistry has large overlap with theoretical chemistry and molecular physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of calculus in deriving equations. \nTheoretical chemistry is the study of chemistry via theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics). In particular the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is called quantum chemistry. Since the end of the second world war, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry, which is the art of developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems.

Raid also allows things like mirroring (where the 2x 250gig drives look like a single 250 gig drive), with any individual piece of data copied, or ""mirrored"" to both drives. This allows you to have 2 copies of every bit of stored data in case of a drive failure, if you have such critical data. There's also a function called ""striping,"" where data is split evenly across drives to increase performance. \n\nThere's a bunch of other odds and ends, with parity and without, and some bits like Striping + Mirroring, and the like. \n\nThat's basically a very rough overview of RAID. As a general rule, if you didn't know what RAID is, likely you don't particularly need it. Most likely it can be safely removed, unless your system came preconfigured for RAID, which is a bit unlikely."

For each survey, you earn points (the points differ from survey to survey).  When you get 1000 points, you can request a check for $10.  2000 points gets you $20, etc.  It's slow-going, but the only really profitable survey site out there."

6463,"Hi Doc...\n\nWell, if you followed the steps I gave you last time you asked this, then the problem is probably hardware-related. To find out for sure, get a voltmeter, set it to DC volts. \nThe USB interface consists of 4 pins. The two outside pins supply power to the device, and the inside pins are for data. Polarity need not be observed if you are using a digital voltmeter. With the computer booted up and running in Windows, put one lead of the voltmeter on one outside pin of a USB port, and the other lead on the other outside pin. If the meter reads 5 volts (regardless of polarity), then the USB ports are getting power, and the USB hub has probably failed. This problem is a depot-level problem, and only a warranty replacement or costly service will fix it. However... If the voltmeter reads zero, then your 5volt power connector inside the laptop case has probably disconnected. If the machine is within warranty, by all means take advantage. If not, then disassembly will be required. If your next Yahoo Question is ""How do you take apart a Dell Laptop"" then I will assume that your USB ports failed the voltage check, and I'll go into the disassembly procedures there."

Jackson went way longer then he needed to. \n\nYou probably want to wait till they are 14 or 15. The scenes with the natives are pretty dicey and can easily scare young teenagers. Also, there are a bunch of scenes that are startling including dinosaurs and massive insects. \n\nBut for all its action, it does have a connection between naomi Watts (sp?) and Kong that you don't see in most action films. My ex-girlfriend actually started crying when they starting to strafe Kong. \n\nAlso Jack Black doesn't say or do anything funny in the movie whatsoever.

6606,"An expert system is a class of computer programs developed by researchers in artificial intelligence during the 1970s and applied commercially throughout the 1980s. In essence, they are programs made up of a set of rules that analyze information (usually supplied by the user of the system) about a specific class of problems, as well as provide analysis of the problem(s), and, depending upon their design, recommend a course of user action in order to implement corrections.\n\nTypically, the problems to be solved are of the sort that would normally be tackled by a human ""expert""—a medical or other professional, in most cases. Real experts in the problem domain (which will typically be very narrow, for instance ""diagnosing skin diseases in human teenagers"") are asked to provide ""rules of thumb"" on how they evaluate the problems, either explicitly with the aid of experienced system developers, or sometimes implicitly, by getting such experts to evaluate test cases and using computer programs to examine the test data and (in a strictly limited manner) derive rules from that. Generally expert systems are used for problems for which there is no single ""correct"" solution which can be encoded in a conventional algorithm — one would not write an expert system to find shortest paths through graphs, or sort data, as there are simply easier ways to do these tasks.\n\nSimple systems use simple true/false logic to evaluate data, but more sophisticated systems are capable of performing at least some evaluation taking into account real-world uncertainties, using such methods as fuzzy logic. Such sophistication is difficult to develop and still highly imperfect"

After watching his press conference today, a sense of shame overtook me. I'm ashamed that he took to the podium today as if he emptied out a container of laughing gas. I'm ashamed of a President who has the temerity to laugh when asked a question about war. I'm ashamed of the whores of the fourth estate who care more about having the honor of being the butt of one of the President's jokes than about exposing the truth to the American people. I'm ashamed that millions of my fellow Americans are so scared and so desperate for leadership that they believe the President's bullshit. \n\nI am ashamed. I'm ashamed of this President, this megalomaniac hellbent on leaving his assprint on the map of the Middle East, no matter how much destruction is wrought and no matter how much blood flows in the streets of lands that never threatened us. I'm ashamed that when I see the American flag waiving, images of flag-draped coffins flash in my mind. I'm ashamed of Freedom's March. Ashamed when I see villages reduced to rubble. Ashamed when I see the tiny little corpses. God, they're so painfully tiny--lined up in a row, little angels wrapped in colorful blankets that starkly contrast against their gray-tinged faces. Ashamed when I see wailing Iraqis slam their hands against plain, unvarnished coffins, over and over, asking ""Why? Is this democracy? Why?"" When I see those image of funerals, of broken families, I want to crawl into my TV, I want to go to them and grab their slumped shoulders and scream ""I'm sorry, good god, I'm so sorry. I want to leave, I want us to leave, believe me. But they won't listen...No one listens anymore."" \n\nI'm ashamed that the word ""massacre"" is even uttered in connection with our actions in Iraq. I'm ashamed it's not just one massacre that is alleged, but two. I'm ashamed it's gotten to the point that I can't even tell this little voice inside of me to shut up, that little voice that says maybe, just maybe it could be true. That the impossible may be plausible. Before this war, I would have rejected such claims outright. But that voice of plausibility is the consequence of those black hoods. It's the consequence of those leashes, those snarling dogs. It's the consequence of those detainees chained to bedframes. Of naked pyramids. Of forced sex acts. Of beatings and blood-streaked floors. \n\nI am ashamed. Ashamed that Justice is no longer blindfolded, but gagged. Ashamed that in America, in AMERICA, I can only protest in ""free speech zones"" the size of postage stamps. Ashamed that by the time I'll take my oath as an officer of the court to support the Constitution, I'll be swearing to uphold a tattered document that has managed to survive over 200 years only to be shredded by this President in less than eight. \n\nI am ashamed. Ashamed that in America, I see bearded men panhandling in the street, holding cardboard signs that read ""U.S. Vet, can't work, need food. God bless."" Ashamed that somewhere, in our America, a grandmother is sitting alone at her kitchen table, crumpled bills clutched in her thin hands, agonizing over the choice before her: medicine for her pain, or food to keep on living. Ashamed that there is a child who will go to sleep tonight on a cot in an orphanage, with no one to read him a story, no one to stroke his hair and kiss him goodnight, because the American Taliban thinks gay Americans can't love, can't parent, can't provide. \n\nI am ashamed of my fellow Americans.

And in seeking acceptance they try them. Over time they develop dependency and a strong attachment to them, the same way they do to liquor or tobacco. For some obscure reason the latter are still legal and the former is not. This in turn creates a logical sociogenic outcome: Druglords, and the ensuing trail of bloodshed, crime and lack of welfare in drug producing nations. Legalizing drugs would at least turn druglords into businesspersons and it would raise a profitable industry....in the early stages. Drugs would eventually become so ""mainstream"" that many kids would not find it a challenge to use them. But I woke up from that dream long a go; governments thrive on druglords, either in Colombia, Mexico or the US."

Now after soooo many disappointments I´m using Data Entry Pro and it´s now making me money (finally!) online. \n\nAnyway, basically you sign up with them and then once your logged in you just fill in as many forms as you like in their members section and you get paid for each one. I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $250-$350. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra income stream aswell as my full time job so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \n\nYou do have to be prepared to spend a little money though if you want to do anything online like this but it´s already been worth it for me.\n\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \n\nHope this helps!\nGoodluck,\nDave"

Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes. \n\nIn the instructions at Grants.gov, you have to first go to CFDA to find out the grant number that you qualify. You can search CFDA various ways (by grant number, by keyword, etc.). You can find grant programs by category -- here are the lists of grants under Home Buying/Homeownership http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.FIND_GRANT_PROGRAM_TXT.SHOW?p_arg_names=func_cat_cd&p_arg_values=ML  Check if any applies to you\n\nTo make searching easier, Housing and Urban Development HUD has a list of housing grants http://www.hud.gov/offices/adm/grants/fundsavail.cfm - though I have NOT seen any grants available for first time homeowners.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"

6682,"The death penalty is much more expensive than its closest alternative, which is life imprisonment with no parole. Capital trials are longer and more expensive at every step than other murder trials. Pre-trial motions, expert witness investigations, jury selection, and the necessity for two trials--one on guilt and one on sentencing--make capital cases extremely costly, even before the appeals process begins. Guilty pleas are almost unheard of when the punishment is death. In addition, many of these trials result in a life sentence rather than the death penalty, so the state pays the cost of life imprisonment on top of the expensive trial."

While in the NBL with teams largely consisting of small Midwestern towns the Nationals put together a 21-23 record finishing in 4th place. In the playoffs the Nats, would be beaten by the fellow upstate neighbor Rochester Royals in 4 years.\n\n1947/48: In their second season the Nationals would struggle finishing in 5th place with a 24-36 record. Despite their struggles the Nats would make the playoffs getting swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in 3 straight games.\n\n1948/49: Several teams begin to leave the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for a merger is laid. Staying in the NBL the Nationals sign AL Cervi to be player coach as Dolph Schayes makes his professional debut leading the Nats to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40-23. In the playoffs the Nationals would make quick work of the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers winning the series in 2 straight games. However, in the semifinals the Nats would fall to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in 4 games. Following the season the remaining NBL teams would join the BAA as the two leagues merged and became the NBA.\n\nNBA Years:\n \n1949/50: The Nationals were an instant success in the NBA winning the Eastern Division with a league best record of 51-13. In the playoffs the Nationals would continue to play solid basketball beating the Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight. Moving on to the Eastern Finals the Nationals would battle the New York Knickerbockers beating their big city rivals in a 3-game series. Moving on to the NBA Finals the Nationals would face fellow NBL alum Minneapolis Lakers. In Game 1 of the Finals the Nats would lose just their 2nd home game of the season 68-66. The Nats would not recover as they fell behind 3 games to 1 before falling in 6 games. \n\n1950/51: Despite several teams leaving the NBA to reorganize the NBL the Nationals deiced to stay put. In their second NBA season the Nationals would play mediocre basketball all season finishing in 4th place with a record of 32-34. However, in the playoffs the Nats would play their best basketball of the season as they stunned the 1st place Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91-89. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nationals would be beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard fought 5-game series losing the finale by just 2 points.         \n\n1951/52: Al Cervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game, as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40-26 record. In the playoffs the Nats would knock the Philadelphia Warriors off again in a 3-game series. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nats would fall to the New York Knickerbockers again dropping the series in 4 games.\n\n1952/53: The Nationals would finish in 2nd place in a hard fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division with a record of 47-24. In the playoffs the Nationals would face the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87-81. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals would take the Celtics deep in to overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111-105, in what remains the longest game in NBA history.\n\n1953/54: The Nationals acquire Alex Groza and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams. Once again the Nationals would battle for the Division title falling 2 games short with a 42-30 record. In the playoffs the Nats would win all 4 games of a round robin tournament involving the 3 playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals the Nats would stay hot beating"

Its a small tool designed to safely and easily cut stitches without damaging the material.\n\nIf it is an iron-on patch, although you can get it off, some of the glue will often remain on the cloth and discolor it.  You must have an iron, and either the protective paper used to put the patch on or a crisp, clean cloth.  \n\nI have found that wetting the cloth beneath the patch helps.  Put the cloth or protective paper over the patch and heat it until it is loose and use some clamping scissors or tweezers to peel the patch off.  You must quickly scrape off the glue using a clean, flat-bladed tool like a putty knife or a butter knife.\n\nGood luck, it's not an easy procedure."
6711,"How did Apple Computer, Inc get it's name?\n\nSteve Jobs had worked during the summer at an apple farm, and admired the Beatles' record label, Apple. He also believed Apples to be the most perfect fruit. He and Steve Wozniak were trying to figure out a name for their new company, and they decided that if they couldn't think of one by the end of the day that was better than Apple, they would choose Apple. They couldn't think of anything better, so on April 1, 1976, Apple Computer, Inc. was born.\n\nBut they needed a logo. The first design included Sir Isaac Newton, a tree and a banner that said ""Apple Computer."" Jobs decided they needed a less busy logo, one that would signify a brand. The second logo attempt was very similar to the current logo, but without the bite taken out of it. Jobs thought this logo looked too much like an orange. The third attempt was the logo that Apple still uses."

Even when I was into drugs, he kept it all covered up so that I could continue my path toward public service. Then I joined the Reserves, but only because I thought it would be cool to fly a jet plane. So my Dad arranged that, and then saw to it that I could get out of any real 'military service' since I was too busy bilking investors out of millions of dollars. My brothers might not have killed a movie star, but one of them caused the infamous Silverado Savings & Loan scandal; my other brother helped me steal an election (or two) with fraudulent voting 'chads' and irregularities in how those votes were tabulated. Then my Dad's influence with Supreme Court justices helped me go on to become the best damn president this country ever's seen! I enjoy hanging out with my capitalist buddies and planning how to illegally invade sovereign nations just so we can grab all the oil underneath their sands and make me, my buddy Big Dick, and all our cowboy friends richer and richer and richer.\nWhat the heck, we've killed tens of thousands of Iraqi women and children, and more than 2,500 American soldiers, but like my buddy Donnie Rumsfeld once said at a news conference, ""Stuff Happens."" \nI've single-handedly put this country trillions of dollars in debt, while playing ""Robin Hood in Reverse"" (that's where we take from the poor and give it all to the rich). \nWith the help of a pliable, cowardly, corrupt U.S. Congress, I've dismantled the U.S. Constitution, destroyed all environmental-impact laws and regulations that were designed to keep our fragile ecology in place, and turned this country into a police state where citizens are considered guilty until proven innocent in a rigged court of law.\nSmall countries all over the Earth are now terrified of the U.S., and are considering their own nuclear weapons programs just to defend themselves against the globe's newest ""evil empire' - the United States of America!\nI condonded all of my friend Donnie Rumsfeld's unspeakable terror, torture tactics, abuse and murder until the damn press got wind of it all. Then I put on my best actors' face and told gullible Americans that I think it was unconscionable. Ya' gotta love Ronald Reagan for writin' the Republican manual on great acting!\nI watch out for my wealthy elitist friends, lobbyists, special interest groups and huge corporations that can all make generous (if not illegal) contributions to help keep the GOP in power. Meanwhile, we like to neglect the needs of the poor, the aged, the homeless, the disabled, the underprivileged, and the unemmployed. Why should those scumbags think they have a right to live in America anyway?\nI've pretty much accomplished everything my Dad and Big Dick told me to do, all without much accountability or remorse. But, then I've lived the life of a spoiled rich kid who never had to take any responsibility for his actions. I just wish I could find an intern in the White House with whom I could have oral sex (of course, she'd have to proclaim to be a born-again Christian).\nI'm not sure whether I should retire from public office of wait until I'm impeached or tried for high treason and crimes against humanity. \nBig Dick and Donnie say there's a special oil-soaked corner of Hell that Satan's reserved just for us where we can spend our eternal damnation blaming each other for what a mess we made of the world. \nAnd, maybe, if you're as confused and drunk as you are right now, we can have a drink and talk about our differences. Just make sure I'm within earshot of Big Dick so he can tell me exactly what to say. Ain't politics great? It don't matter whether you're a Republican or a Democra"

6770,"Unfortunately, you are mistaken.  Nearly all horses can run the initial 2 furlongs in 24 seconds or less, yet very few can run the last 2 furlongs in less than 24 seconds.  The pace of the race and the outcome are determined by multiple factors.  If you have a horse in a race and that horse is the ""controlling speed"" many times you have the winner.  If that same horse is not the ""controlling speed"" and gets ""hooked"", i.e. a horse breaks even beside it, that horse, unless he is a superior animal will not win the race.  The pace will quicken and both horses will tire mid-stretch and be beaten.  A horse coming from well off the pace will benefit by a fast pace up front, provided one single horse does not clear the field and slow the fractions down.  In other words, the faster the race is run in the early stages, the more likely a horse mid-running or closing from well back will run past them late in the race.\nThere is NO mathematical solution, regarding acceleration, stride length that has ever stood the test of time. \nHence, IF the ""fastest"" horse always won, the favorites would win 100% of the time.  Industry wide, the ""fastest/betting favorite"" only wins 38% of the time. That means that 62% of the time the ""fastest/betting favorite"" loses. \nGood luck, but the game involves much more than mathematical equations.  There are different surfaces, multiple drugs administered, and many trainers are not even trying to win TODAY, they would much rather win later at bigger odds. \nThat, in a nutshell, is the reality.\nI'm a 50+ year old man who has played horses for over 35 years and numbers should only be a guide, never the rule.\nI would be happy to further elaborate if need be. \nGood luck to you"

6791,"Thats a tough job for any software. LOL. Anywayz you could try this method. Download an mp3 cutter software, load the first track, cut the first line and save it as a separate track. Load the second track into the same program and cut the second line and save it as another track. Continue this until you have a large number of files which are made up of single lines. ( This will take up a large amount of space ) \n\nThen use and mp3 joiner software and join the tracks in the order you want to. This is quite tiresome and the result wont be music either."

I love being in nature and learning about how plants and animals live in an ecosystem- but I cannot read scientific abstracts even though I am a college graduate.\n\nWhen I want to learn something - I look for books on a third grade reading level.  Seriously, I was able to learn what I needed about viruses from a third grade level book written by Howard and Margery Facklam.\n\nYour other option is to find a tutor.  I am not ashamed that when I was losing my way in French - I got another student to tutor me.  \n\nIf you cannot work it out with a student - go to either your science teacher or another science teacher you feel comfortable with and ask for help.\n\nTeachers love to see students ""get it,"" so don't be afraid to share that you are confused by some of your assignments."

6796,"Players who play for any national team (such as England) have to be a citizen of that country, and not have played for any other countries.\n\nSo for the England team, they are all English, and all born in England, apart from Owen Hargreaves, who is Canadian, but because of passports and parents' nationalites could have chosen to play for England, Germany or Canada, and I think Scotland or Wales if he had chosen. Unfortunatley for England, he chose to play for them. He really is terrible!\n\nIf you mean English league teams, then the laws about these are dictated by EU law - any citizen of any EU country is free to work their chosen trade in any other EU country. This is the same for all EU countries and leagues (Spain, Italy, France etc etc).\n\nEach league has slightly different rules for non-EU players, depending on their countries labour laws and local decisions, but in England I don't think teams can field more than 3 non-EU passport holders in a team, and these palyers must play in a certain number of games each season, or their work permits are withdrawn.\n\nThere has been controversy in the past with football agents getting Portugese passports for Brazilians - allowing them to play in the EU without the restrictions that normally apply to Brazilian players."

6802,"A good example is when you buy a new car battery.  Maybe for one whole year if that battery goes bad, they will replace it free. After the year, if the battery goes bad you will not get a free replacement but will get maybe 75% of the price of your battery. The longer you have the battery the less the replacement sum will be. It is prorated according to how long you have had the use of the battery versus how much more use you are guaranteed. A five year battery that goes bad in the first year will be prorated to give you a free battery or a pretty big portion of the cost of that battery. A five year battery that fails in the fourth year will be prorated according to the fact that this is a four year old battery with one more year of warranty. You might just get 25% of the value of a new battery."

Tell them you want to learn about money management...it's never too early to start that.  Most parents agree that it's a good idea to give some kind of allowance.

6812,"commodity \nThe word commodity is a term with distinct meanings in business and in Marxian political economy. For the former, it is a largely homogenous product, whereas for the latter, it refers generically to wares offered for exchange.\n\nLinguistically, the word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century, being derived from the French word ""commodité"" meaning ""benefit, profit"", similar in meaning to biens (goods). The Latin root meaning is commoditas, referring variously to the appropriate measure of something; a fitting state, time or condition; a good quality; efficaciousness or propriety; and advantage, or benefit. The German equivalent is die Ware, i.e. wares or goods offered for sale."

6815,"An organization in which well-managed human diversity is woven throughout all functions and levels is better able to meet the major business challenge of the 21st century--the need for adaptability. Organizational adaptability is necessary for success in a business environment characterized by the proliferation of markets across a wide spectrum of national, cultural and ethnic boundaries in the U.S. and abroad and by increasing competition everywhere. \n\nDiversity in Business: Highlights\n• Diversity optimizes the willingness and ability of all employees to contribute to business success. \n\n• Demographic trends indicate a workplace of the future comprising ever more human differences. \n\n• Diversity differs from affirmative action in its emphasis on qualitative, not quantitative, goals. \n\n• Research shows that heterogeneity contributes to productivity and innovation in working groups. \n\n• Diversity training reduces stereotyping, prejudice and cross-cultural misunderstandings. \n\n• A ""culture of inclusion"" requires institutional openness to diverse styles, ideas and perspectives. \n\n• Diversifying a firm's leadership is indispensable for attaining the long-term benefits of diversity. \n\n• A diversity audit is an excellent first step in planning organizational change to support diversity. \n\n• White male backlash is a significant challenge to diversity. White males cannot be ignored. \n\n• Adaptability is vital in this era of business globalization. Diversity enhances adaptability."

The issue is not to open the border, because I know how much your racist rhetoric would hate to have spanish people sharing the same public fountain as you.

Hard money loan is a mortgage based primarily on the condition and value of the property.  \n\nSome commercial real estate listings for sale use the term ""hard corner"" to describe their property.  A hard corner, as it applies to real estate, seems to be a term used to describe a commercial real estate property located directly on a hard curbed corner.  It is a corner lot located at a busy intersection. There can be a traffic signal at that intersection, or not.  It is a desirable location."

6860,"It's better to make money before you move than to move without money, so I'd recommend taking two jobs for the rest of the time you're in Orlando. Not only will your bank account grow, but you'll spend a lot of time away from the home, which leaves you less time to fight with your ex. Also look at what you are planning to bring on the move with you; household items like dishes and furniture can often be more expensive to move than to replace when you are settled in.  Sell everything you don't absolutely need to bring with you; you may not become rich off of a yard sale but you'll have some more cash and less stuff which makes for easier travel.\n\nIf your goal is to simply be closer to your daughter rather than live with her in NJ, look into Delaware, especially the Wilmington area, for a place to live. Wilmington is experiencing a great phase of growth right now so you may earn more there than you expect, and the cost of living is still fairly reasonable.

6872,"Well, if I understand your question correctly, it sounds as though they are pulling into the finish then coming back up the slide before their hands are out over their knees.....correct?\n\nMy first observation is that if your entire crew is doing this then someone taught them all how to row incorrectly. If it was one girl, then it would just be a problem with her, but with all of them....? That's a coaching error by someone at some point on proper technique. Teach them the mantra ""arms, back, legs...legs, back, arms"" (meaning the parts of the stroke in order starting from the finish back through to the finish).\n\nNevertheless, what you need to do is have them do drills where you break the parts of the stroke up. Row arms only, back only, legs only, arms and back only, legs and back only, etc. They'll learn to differentiate the parts of the stroke.\n\nYou can also do pause drills at hands away - take the stroke, at the finish come to hands away and pause for the count of three - knees should all be down, still sitting back. Do this for a while. Then take the pause to backs over - take the stroke, finish, hands away, back over, then pause for 3 secs. etc.\n\nIt could also be an inability to set the boat - I'm guessing these are relatively novice rowers. As you know when the blade is out of the water the boat wants to roll to one side or the other. The knees up too fast may just be an involuntary reaction to trying to get back up the slide to get the blade back in the water to make the boat stable. To find out if this is the problem, have the 8+ row by 4's or 6's while the other 4 or pair hold the boat on keel. If they are still having the knee problem then it's not a balance issue.\n\ngood luck!"

6876,"web programming is about the most benign thing you can do on a computer (although you may consider dual monitors), as for some of the other things, especially mySQL etc with large databases, ram is good - more is better. For web serving a pIII dual 1GHz box would work just fine, so just about anything you can find out there today will be satisfactory. Depending on the web-server configuration and the number of hits you're getting, multi threading will really pay off though, so look for dual core if you're hosting a really really popular site. Never worked with Oracle, so I can't speak to that one..\n\nWhen you're building a computer, if you want to minimize latency especially on first loads, you'll want a faster hard drive (say a raptor) 10k and 15k rpm drives have lower latencies and can stream data faster. Having more ram (depending on the os) will allow for more data to stay in ram, reducing the number of trips to the hard drive (your biggest data bottleneck on a modern pc).\n\nFor just about any home use, your canned amd64 3500+, 1GB of ram, 7200 rpm 300GB hard drive, geforce 6600gt, 16x dvd drive, and 300-400watt power supply will work just fine.\n\nIf you want cutting edge, amd64 X2 4400+, 2GB low latency (e.g. corsair xms or kingston hyperX) ram, 10k rpm raptors (or 15krpm scsi, but you'll have to get a card and possibly 80-60 pin converter), and a 7800GTX or X1800/1900.\n\nIMO unless you're doing predominantly video work, stay away from intel for now, they're too hot and for just about everything else, you'll get better performance out of an amd64."

6889,"Law enforcement officers are, as their name suggests, people entrusted by the government to enforce the law that government lays down. The key word in this case is entrusted. Even today, with terrorism, high security everywhere and political unrest, every facet of society is becoming more distrusting of the general public, who they suspect want to blow them up (talk about pathological paranoid schitzophrenia hey?), and these are the people in high positions of power. Trust takes a long time to develop, and so a chain of command has been established whereby the more dangerous and the longer time you spend serving the government's interests, the better the departments of that government will treat you, including law enforcement. There are likewise stereotype offenders in the gen. pop. that police target, for the same reason: less service to the gov't = worse treatment.\nThe point of all this is to emphasize that a government is not going to allow a law to be amended, changed or repealed that takes responsibility away from the people the gov't trusts, so that the gen. pop. is a little more comfortable.\nSo my answer then, is if you want something done that a powerful force is against, you need to be more powerful that that force, or atleast a threat to their sense of power. This means building gen. pop. support for your cause, not by petition (these are ignored without the following), and not with a public rally in a park that affects noone, but with actions that undermine the power that government wields over the gen. pop. and sending that message up the chain of command that they are losing control and must yield to your demands. Always remember, you are not at war with the government, they are not your enemy! you are revolting (starting a revolution) that will benefit both you and them, and you are asking assertively for their help in justifying such change. Guns, violence, aggression and injury/death will not solve anything; infact it will make it worse, escalating out of control where all concerned forget the point and just try to stay alive and out of jail (how did I get myself into this mess?). This is not only about improving crime - anticrime interaction procedures, but about maintaining societal peace. It's about sending a big message of popular dissatisfaction and unrest, not with handcuffs and cellbars. Play smart, not hard!"

Normally, a child object will inherit the same rights and permissions as the parent object, but you can actually go in and change the permissions.  For instance, say you have a file folder for financial stuff.  The permissions for this folder may be open to all.  Then, inside this folder, you have other folders for each individual person in the house.  These would be child objects of the main folder.  You could then go in and change the permissions so that only that particular person could open that folder and no one else could, even though they all have access to the main folder.

7020,"Azumah Nelson (born September 19, 1958) is a former boxer who was a three time world champion. A native of Ghana, Nelson is not a prince: He is not related to the Ashanti royal family. He is from a different tribe. He is from the Ga tribe. He used to wear a crown into the ring before his boxing fights.\n\nNelson also has endured personal loss: His wife of many years died during the 1990s of cancer.\n\nNelson's professional boxing debut, in 1979, did not cause much furor, except in Ghana, where he was known because of his family ties. Internationally, Nelson lacked the recognition for such an event to be given its due importance. With the years, however, all of that changed because he garnered world wide fame as a boxer.\n\nHe beat Billy Kwame in Accra by a decision in eight to mark his professional debut. In his third fight, he fought on March 3 of 1980, he knocked out Henry Sadler in the ninth round to win Ghana's regional 126 pound title. On December 13 of that year, he knocked out Joe Skipper in round 10 to add the African continent's belt to his Ghanian regional championship.\n\n1981 was a productive year for the young fighter. He beat Bozzou Aziza in his first fight abroad; held in Togo, and then he beat Miguel Ruiz in his first United States fight, held in California. He added the British commonwealth's Featherweight title with a five round knockout of Brian Roberts.\n\nDespite all his early achievements and being undefeated in 13 fights, Nelson was virtually unknown outside Ghana. Because of this, he was a decisive underdog when he challenged WBC world Featherweight champion Salvador Sanchez on June 21 of 1982 at the Madison Square Garden in New York. Despite losing that fight by a knockout in round 15, Nelson's stock as a boxer rose after that fight, and he established himself as a deserving leading contender in the eyes of many fans. Sanchez sadly passed away almost two months after this fight, suffering a car accident in Mexico City. Sanchez-Nelson was Salvador Sanchez's last fight.\n\nIn his next fight, Nelson knocked out fringe contender Irving Mitchell in eight rounds.\n\nNelson won all four of his fights in 1983, and he began 1984 by beating Hector Cortez by decision on March 9 in Las Vegas. Then, on December 8 of that year, he became boxing royalty by knocking out Wilfredo Gomez in round 11 to win the WBC world Featherweight championship. Behind on the three judges' scorecards, Nelson rallied in that last round to become champion in Puerto Rico.\n\nNelson held on to that title for three years. He could not fight for 9 months after the Gomez bout, but when he returned, he retained the title in Miami with a fifth round knockout of Juvenal Ordenes in September 1985, and then in October of that year, he retained it again with a first round knockout of Pat Cowdell in Birmingham, England. The Cowdell knockout in particular became a highlight film material: Cowdell was left frozen on the canvas by Nelson's knockout punch.\n\nIn 1986, he retained the title two times, beating future world champion Marcos Villasana and former Barry McGuigan challenger Danilo Cabrera (once again, in Puerto Rico).\n\nIn 1987, Nelson retained the title against Mauro Guitierrez, by a knockout in round six, and in a rematch with Villasana, once again, by decision. After the second fight with Villasana, Nelson abandoned the WBC's World Featherweight title.\n\nNelson began 1988 by fighting former Julio Cesar Chavez rival Mario Martinez for the vacant WBC's world Jr. Lightweight title. He beat Martinez by decision in 12 rounds on February 29 at Los Angeles to become world Jr. Lightweight champion, and then he defended the title with a knockout in round nine against former world champ Lupe Suarez and with a knockout in three over Sydney Del Rovere.\n\nHe proceeded in 1989 by beating Martinez in a rematch, by knockout in round 12, and then fighting Jim McDonnell, with exactly the same result. The fight with M"

It's not likely that interest rates will shoot up quickly. So ask yourself if the people of the area you are thinking about have a reason to leave the area suddenly.\n\nIf they don't, then there will likely be no real estate bubble in that area. \n\nReal Estate is not a short term investment and it's not as liquid as stocks. Stocks can go to zero but it's EXTREMELY difficult for real estate to go to zero.\n\nThe real estate bubble scare has been brought upon by stock brokerages and/or the media since they are tied together or invest in each other. Don't buy into it.\n\nReal Estate is a finite commodity. However, stock shares can be split forever it seems. Also real estate is unique, even if it's in the same complex, if a condo. Is each share of the same stock unique? No, one share of MSFT, for example, is exactly like another share of MSFT! \n\nSo in my opinion, yes real estate can drop by 10%, 15% or 20% but I wouldn't call it a bubble. The price will likely come back up in time, unless the area has been cursed forever. For less risk, buy in an area that's got potential, is near good schools, near shops, near transportation, has a good real estate history and near jobs.\n\nMy strongest suggestion if you are serious in buying is to speak to a good Realtor, (go to http://www.ReferredPro.com) to be referred to one, who can give you some guidance, especially since they work with lots of people in your shoes who are thinking the same thing and lots of others who are making money in real estate. Warning: friends don't necessarily give the best advice, even when they think they are."

A Judge should have descretion to sentence to probation, house arrest, a half way house, intensive therapy or whatever IF and ONLY IF after a thorough evaluation including a a psycological exam it is determined to be the most effective in rehabilitating the offender. The article did not mention if any of this was done. \n\nPrison is supposed to be about rehabilitation and not just punishment.

Alternate between the following two workouts: \n\n1) Quick Bursts- 30-45 second intervals at the fastest tempo possible without breaking your rhythm, with 1 minute rests between each repetition. Try 3 sets of 3 reps. with a 2 minute rest between each set. \n\n2) Endurance- Jump 20 minutes at a moderated pace, alternating your foot patterns throughout the workout. Set goals of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes without a ""miss"". Jump with a walkman on, listening to your stereo, or while watching TV. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Primary: wrists, ankles, calves. Secondary: shoulders. SOFT FEET. \n\nInline Skating\nYour primary objective should be to reinforce correct skating techniques. Anytime you are in skates, hockey or inline, correct skating motions should be executed. This will develop good habits, not bad ones. Assuming you do this, enjoy a nice sunny day on your blades and remember to ALWAYS wear a helmet and sufficient protective equipment. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training and technical skills training. Train on your inline skates 2-3 times per week. To avoid dehydration and sun burn, skate in the morning or evening and drink plenty of fluids. Select a safe, newly paved surface. \n\n1) Distance Training- skate a 50% speed for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend. Try to find a route with changing scenery. \n\n2) Technical Skills Training- Work on your skating and puck control skills for 30-45 minutes. Create drills to develop your forward and backward strides, crossunders, turns, stickhandling, passing, and shooting. This is a mental workout, rather than a physical workout. The emphasis is on precise execution, not power or speed. Skills must be practiced at a learnable rate. Again, for technical skills training ideas and effective drills, call 1-800-320-7545 for our latest hockey skills training video. \n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\nSlideBoard Training\nA training tool widely used by international speedskaters and competitive hockey players to develop leg strength, correct striding, and to provide a challenging cardiovascular workout. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training, quick burst training, and technical skills training. Incorporate slide board workouts 2-3 times per week. \n\n1) Distance Training- stroke a 50% thrust for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend and a consistent head level. Swing your arms back and forth to involve your upper body and to finish the transfer of body weight. Adjust the slide board to a challenging length. \n\n2) Quick Burst Training- Adjust the board to a shorter length. Maintain controlled strides, pick up the tempo of your strides to approximately twice that of your distance training. Three sets of three 30 -45 second bursts at 80-90%. Rest 1 minute between reps and 2 minutes between sets. \n\n3) Technical Skills Training- Complete, explosive leg thrust and upper body control must be maintained throughout any workout involving striding motions. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\n\nRunning Steps/Stairs\nThis could very well be one of the best cross-training activities, one that simulates game-like situations, challenges you mentally and physically, and allows you to breathe fresh outside air on a nice summer day. Step training will develop explosive leg strength and quick burst speed. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Go to your local high school or stadium and run 2-4 sets of 3 reps, 1-2 times per week. Each repetition should involve a 20-30 second burst up the steps, with 45 second rest intervals between each rep. Concentrate on exploding off deep kneebend, swinging arms front to back, and maintaining a level head position. Change your step workouts to include running every other step, or using only "

Some are free to park on, some it is illegal to park on.\n\nBy making people buy permits to park on a particular street or neighborhood the local government might be trying to serve the residents of that neighborhood by limiting who parks on the street. By putting up parking meters, a city government might be trying to help local merchants by forcing a turnover of parking spots so that more customers can find parking.\n\nThere can be lots of reasons for local governments to do such things, not the least of which is to generate additional revenue to pay for city services.

7214,"That's a pretty heavy statement...""the Peruvian government is flooding our streets with cocaine"". By the way, Colombia produces more cocaine than Peru, so maybe their government is doing it too?  Most of the cocaine produced in Peru is financed by the major Colombian cartels, that doesn't mean the Colombian government endorses drug trafficking.\n\nAnyway, Peru's national products are copper, silver, gold, petroleum, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, hydro power, natural gas, coffee, cotton, sugarcane, rice, potatoes, corn, plantains, grapes, oranges, coca; poultry, beef, dairy products; fish.  As you can see, cocaine is not part of the list.\n\nAs someone already said, the problem is more complex than that. Yes, there are some Peruvian government officials involved in drug trafficking, as well as there are American officials involved too.  But to say that the government of Peru is directly involved in the production and trafficking of cocaine is completely erroneous."

7216,"Swan Lake (Russian: Лебединое Озеро) is one of the most famous and critically-acclaimed ballets, with music by Tchaikovsky.\n\nThe original ballet was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia on February 20, 1877 and remained in the repertoire until 1883. After Tchaikovsky's death, the ballet was revised by his brother Modest and the conductor Riccardo Drigo. This revised version received its premiere at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg on January 15, 1895 with choreography by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, and many later stagings have followed their work more or less closely.\n\nA single dancer dances the twin roles of Odette and Odile, which is one of the most taxing of all roles because it requires acting two entirely contrasting characters, as well as the strenuous showpiece dancing itself, including thirty-two fouettés. This feat was put into the choreography because it was a party piece of Pierina Legnani, first prima ballerina assoluta of the Maryinsky ballet. Pavel Gerdt played Prince Siegfried.\n\nThe ballet's premiere in St. Petersburg was very poorly received. It had lackluster costumes and scenery, unusual choreography, and a mediocre orchestra. It also departed from the traditional Russian format of ballet, which used a story with just enough plot to sustain the virtuoso dancing; Tchaikovsky's ballet, on the other hand, included a well-unified storyline which lost much of the audience. A later revival in the year after Tchaikovsky's death was acclaimed as a masterpiece, however, having used phenomenal talent in all aspects."

Amelie. This is a French movie directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Alien Resurrection and The City of Lost Children), and using a very vivid colorful style, this movie is about a young woman who, one day when she discovers a small cigar box left in her house for years, decides to help people out in mysterious, anonymous ways. But when she meets the guy of her dreams, can she find the courage to do for herself what she has done for others?\n\nComedy: Young Frankenstein. The best film Mel Brooks ever made, and one of the funniest comedies of all time, this film stars Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory) as the legendary Dr. Frankenstein, in this classic parody of the classic Frankenstein movies. One of the funniest moments in this movie is when the Frankenstein monster visits an old blind hermit, played by Gene Hackman, who offers to feed the monster, and does things to the monster like pour hot things like soup and coffee in his lap and light his thumb on fire. This movie is not to be missed!\n\nHorror: Suspiria. Not very hard to find, this is an Italian movie (dubbed in English) about a young woman who arrives at a dance school and quickly discovers that strange things are going on in the school, including mysterious murders. Filmed using very vivid visual colors, the film's haunting music was performed by a group called The Goblins.\n\nAnime: 1) Princess Mononoke. This is an amazing movie about a young man called Ashitaka, who after one day of saving his hometown from a demon, gets cursed by the demon and has to leave the town and go on a journey to discover a cure for himself before the curse spreads over his whole body and kill him. In the meantime he comes across a war that's being fought b/n people and the gods of the forest, which are giant animals, and only wanting peace, tries to stop it. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, this beautiful, exciting epic film has a message about preserving life.\n\n2) The Irresponsible Captain Tylor. This is actually a TV series, made in about 1993. The character of the title is a 20yo boy who likes to hit on any pretty female he sees. After seeing an advertisement w/a pretty girl in it, he decides to sign up for the United Planet Space Force and becomes an officer. Blessed with incredible luck, he very quickly rises in rank to captain of the starship Soyokaze, and has to deal with the Raalgon Empire, whom the UPSF is at war with. Not to be missed, one of the funniest aspects of this show is that when everything seems dire for Tylor and his crew in a battle with the Raalgon, somehow his luck prevails and he surprisingly comes out victorious.\n\nHope that helps!"

You could search ebay for 4-track or 8-track recorders or ""studio recorders"".  What such a device will do is split the tape into 4 or 8 sections... each of which carries its own information.  For example, track-one might carry the drums recording, track-2 might have the bass-guitar recording, track-3 might include your media sample at the proper time...etc  (you get the idea).\n\n   When you have your tracks recorded, such a machine will output everything together to a line-out jack (usually a mini-plug like headphones, but sometimes a 1/4'' plug).  You can then record it all to one track of tape, cd, mp3, or whatever you can plug it into.\n\nNow, studio recorders used to be pretty expensive, but as computers have taken over their role in large part, you can often find used ones pretty cheap.  As I suggested, try ebay.  You may also find that a small local recording studio will do the mix for you for a small fee.\n\nI hope this helps you."

7272,"I understand your sentiments.  I myself am an American finishing up a PhD in England.  Alas, you cannot trade your own citizenship.  Citizenship is, for the most part, an inalienable right.  While the US government has in the past attempted to revoke the citizenship rights of certain parties convicted of treason, the Supreme Court has actually ruled such actions as unconstitutional as 'Cruel and Unusual Punishment'.\n\nMy suggestion to you, if you are set on moving to and working in a specific country, would be to do a 'dry-run' so to speak.  If you know that country's immigration rules you probably already know that you can move there temporarily to look for work, usually for a period of 3 to 6 months.  In many countries, such as Britain, once you're in the country it is much easier to find work there.  Once you've found work get a temporary work visa.  In many countries, again, like Britain, once you've lived in country for 1 year you are eligible to go through the naturalization process.  You can be naturalized in any country in the world, you just have to be willing to go through the beauracratic processes to reach that point.  They may seem daunting, but if you're set on moving to and staying in a different country, there is no reason to hesitate to seek naturalization."

For instance, if you are arrested in your city and then later the police decide not to file a report or charges and everything is dropped, THIS DOES NOT MEAN a record has been erased. It might have been erased at the city and state level but EVERY arrest made, regardless or whether it is dropped or not, is sent directly to the FBI. Since the boom of the Internet search engine and skip tracing technology for the every day person, many private businesses can now get their hands on this information (sometimes done illegally)...but one private business that can access any FBI record is any business which issues credit or abides by the FDIC ( and doesn't that include almost all businesses now)?

7356,"First of all the slap shot is by far the most overrated shot in hockey.  If you watch any game higher than say bantam the defencemen are the only ones that really take slap shots.  If you have a wicked wrist shot and a snapper you shouldn't be playing back on D leaving you with next to no reason to even use a slap shot.  As a goalie, I know that the problem with the slap shot is that it's so predictable from a shorter distance and much easier for a goalie to stop than a snapper or a wrister while when it's taken from the blue line it's so unpredictable that it rarely ever even on net.\n\nBut if you have your heart set on improving your slap shot, I know a couple things you can do:  \n\nFirst, your stick, lots of people have very different opinions on stick size.  I have found that the majority of guys with mean shots have their sticks to between the chin and the nose on dryland without skates on.  Some think it should be between the chin and the nose on skates though.  Really, whatever you're most comfortable with is what you should be playing with.  You don't want it to be too short otherwise you may miss the ice and shoot air and you don't want it too long or you'll hit the ice too far behind the puck and lose a great deal of power and torque on it.  \n\nSecond, work on your wrist strength.  A great thing to do for this is take a weight with a hole through it, take an old, broken stick or one that you don't mind breaking and a strong string of some sort.  Tie the weight onto the bottom of the string and the other side of the string to the stick.  The weight should be about at your knees when you hold the stick out directly in front of you at shoulder height.  Twist the stick so that the string rolls around it until the weight is at the stick.  Then slowly untwist it.  Make sure you do this forward and backward.  \n\nAnother good one you do with another person.  Take a pipe or a bar that fits well in your hand and you can wrap your hand around it comfortably.  Have the other person grip the bar as tight as they can while you twist it.  Make some kind of dot or marking on one part of it in the middle so you can count rotations.  Twist left, right, forwards, and backwards.  I would say that after about 5 rotations you'll be able to feel it pretty well.\n\nThe absolute best thing you can do to improve your slap shot would be to get out there and practice it over and over again.  If you can't get ice time, get on some roller hockey skates and set up a net or a tarp or something to aim at and line up a bunch of roller hockey balls or tennis balls.  By practicing with roller hockey balls and/or tennis balls you will be able to aim much better as well as it'll help you get better control on the ball and make you feel more confident with a puck next time you're on the ice.  You may also consider taping a stick weight to the bottom of your stick by the heel of your blade just for the dryland practice.  It'll make your stick feel so much lighter when you're on the ice and that too will make you feel so much better with your shot.\n\nGood luck to you and I hope this helps some."

This adds flexibility, as well as speed. The SQL part of MySQL stands for ""Structured Query Language,"" which is the most common language used to access databases. The MySQL database server is the most popular open source database in the world. It is extremely fast and easy to customize, due to its architecture. Extensive reuse of code within the software, along with a minimalist approach to producing features with lots of functionality, gives MySQL unmatched speed, compactness, stability, and ease of deployment. Their unique separation of the core server from the storage engine makes it possible to run with very strict control, or with ultra fast disk access, whichever is more appropriate for the situation."

7413,"There are all kinds:\n\n1/ Tax rebates - they kind of defer taxes for a certain period provided certain conditions are satisfied. These are usually given in areas that are under-served e.g. need to attract business and so forth. The developer gets a kind of deferment on the tax rate and pays a discounted rate. In some markets, the localities oferred rebates for new single-family housing. In Cleveland, for example, the county tried to gentrify some low-income areas by oferring rebates on new SFR construction.\n\n2/ Tax credits - very popular with multi-family properties where the developer is given an incentive to build a new apt complex and lease below market as low-income housing for a certain period. Once the period lapses (say 10 years), the developer can raise rents and lease at market rate. At which point, the developer gets a tax credit that is sometimes used ""as cash"" (i.e. syndication) to raise capital for new/other real estate projects the developer may have on the books. The loophole in the law allowing for syndication will probably be closed by Congress (if they have not done so already) since it creates a myriad of problems from the developer and county angles.\n\nThere are so many other kinds but these are the 2 that I have encountered on more than one occassion."

Even so, there is merit to your concerns but not in the process you suggest.\n\nTo begin with, the Eleventh Amendment was proposed, almost unanimously, at the first meeting of Congress after the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia [1793] which held that a State was liable to be sued by a citizen of another State or of a foreign country. \n\nThe Amendment was recognized and upheld by a number of subsequent cases such as Hans v. Louisiana [1890] which opined, “This Amendment, expressing the will of the ultimate sovereignty of the whole country, superior to all legislatures and all courts, actually reverses the decision of the Supreme Court.”  \n\nWhile this was going on, there was also the debate between the Federal Government and the States as to Sovereignty as relative to State Nullification acts.  That is, a single State legislature deciding that a federal act was unconstitutional and not applicable within the borders of that single State.  This continued until 1868 with the application of the fourteenth Amendment [1868] which was upheld in Texas v. White [1869].\n\nThe point is to get the States back into the game balancing against acts of the federal government.  This can be accomplished with a new Amendment recognizing the Sovereignty of the States and their individual ability to nullify federal acts within their borders."

7462,"The biggest question HOW you shut your system down.  Hitting the power button on your computer won't necessarily shut the system down.  It could put into standby or hibernation mode.\n\nThe only way to guarantee you're computer completely shut down is to go to Start -> Shut Down & hit Shut Down.\n\nAlternatively, your system may include a ""Remote Boot-up"" option.  This is more common with business-related systems, which allows a person (like from the IT department) to boot up a computer remotely.  You'll most likely will need to check your computer's BIOS to see if your computer has this option.\n\nIf your computer does have a ""Remote Boot-up"" option in your BIOS, you'll want to disable it as somebody may be trying to hack into your system & found out about this little option... making it even easier to hack into your system if you're not careful.  Alternatively, you'll probably want a router with a built-in firewall to help prevent this (although it may not protect you from any roommates who are jerking you around with this).\n\nFinally, check for viruses & other malware.  There are some nasty stuff online which may have gotten onto your system somehow (either it's a brand new virus OR you're too stupid/lazy to install & update an anti-virus program...  like my neighbor).  If it gets into the BIOS, it could be able to turn your computer on & off by itself...  although I'm unsure on exactly how, but it could happen as some computer components are becoming more software-controlled.\n\nIf this is the case, call somebody you know that's an expert in computers as you obviously need some help.\n\nI hope this can help you out...  or at least give you some ideas to check."

It bagged me 44.897433 shares in them.\n\nNow, imagine you hold onto them shares for bloody ages, so they rise in value to say 50pence a share.\n\n£0.50 x 44.897433 = £22.45 (or £22.4487165 if you don't round that figure up).\n\nThen of course with Penny stocks they don't usually pay out any dividend...... but imagine how much you can earn with that many shares picked up on the cheap once they've matured enough to pay a dividend to re-invest.\n\nLet's say 10pence a share (just to make it easy to work out)\n£0.10 x 44.897433 shares = £4.49 (practically a refund of your initial investment).\n\nBut you've also gotta remember that as there's so many of them for your money... and you've put a fair bit of money on them (and got bloody loads of shares in them as a result), if they go down in value on you, they can give your portfolio's value a right good kicking... so are as risky as trying to get a bj off an Alligator with toothache."

Perhaps the default channel is already being used in your area or is just really noisy.  There are channels 1-11 to choose from.  (Again this is on your wireless router configuration)  If it is on 1, change it to 6 or 11.  If it is on 11 change it to 1 or 5.   If it is on 4-6 try either 1 or 11 and see which ones are better signal.\n\nKeep in mind that the signal strength isn't the only measurement...make sure it doesn't drop the signal.  An okay signal that is stable is better than a great signal that drops out from time to time (which can happen)\n\nWhen ""tuning"" your antenna position, keep in mind that walls might have metal in them that causes interference too.  Try to provide ""line of sight"" when ever possible between wireless devices.  Glass is fine.  Maybe putting your antenna closer to the window if you are trying to get the signal somewhere else in the house... or putting it closer to a hallway so there is less physical material between the two places."

7483,"Obvious child is right. The reason we don't do that is because Congress has SS money put in the general fund, so it isn't safeguarded from all thier porkbarrel projects.  Convenient apathy.  While I am not a fan of his, Al Gore's famous general idea of a ""Social Security Lock Box"" points out that problem.  First, we should have 401k's available through a third party, and not controlled by Congress.  This shouldn't be forced, either: If people want to be dumb with thier money and not invest, fine.  But if they did, when they tapped into it at retirement, the economy would boom.  Not only that, but it would be helped out while the 401ks were matureing because how they work is the money is invested in companies, and they grow and pay the investments back with intrest.  Of course this will never work because Congress has been spending way too much for decades, and the general fund has virtually been living off SS money.  So right now not only is YOUR SS money that could be GROWING AND helping the economy (Thats a long term and short term investment all in one) just sitting there, its being spent on other things as well by a congressman you don't like and who someone else elected in a different state.  Oh, by the way, Congressmen don't pay into SS, they have thier own special retirement plans. Show's how much they trust it, doesn't it?"

7500,"Canseco, and  Ken Caminiti both admited using steroids. Canseco's book and Caminiti's admission was what broke open the steroids scandal in baseballe. \n\nBonds and Sosa may still face perjury charges over denial of steroid usage. Bonds later ADMITTED using steroids. He claimed he did not know the cream contained steroids. McGwire used steroids before they were banned in baseball and has admitted to their use. \n\nPalmiero was caught in a steroid test by MLB. \n\nGrimsley has confirmed Bond's steroid use as well as admitting he and many others used steroids.  So for those of you who still don't believe Bonds used steroids you have Bonds own admission, you have testimony from several players and you have the indictment of his trainer for giving the steroids to Bonds and other athletes like Giambi and Sheffield.  What more do you need.  A big blinking sign over his head saying ""I used steroids"".  \n\nBonds is also the perfect model for steroid use. He was always a pretty decent power hitter. Normally around 35 HRs a year. On a good year he got close to 40. One season he hit more than 40. Then at an age when most players retire and he was looking very washed up. All of his stats had been in decline, there was even talk about whether he'd retire. What happens next is Bonds suddenly has his best year of his career. Hits more HRs than he'd ever hit in a single season. The next year pretty much doubles his previous best season. He was 36 or 37 when he did this. \n\nSosa again shows the same kind of pattern. Sosa was not scheduled to start in his break out year. Also the year he's reputed to have started using steroids. Sosa had been dumped on the Cubs, his third team and the Cubs were out of patience with him as well. Sosa came very close to being released in the off season. Then all of a sudden he started hitting with power out of nowhere. Sosa credited his hitting instructor. Everybody laughed and figured he was a fluke. He was too old to be a real prospect by then. Instead Sosa went on to win HR crowns and his famous battle with fellow steroid user McGwire for the single season HR record. \n\nGary Sheffield and Jason Giambi were both implicated by testimony and with reasonable certainty can be called steroid users. I think Giambi has even since admitted using them. \n\nOther big names have had rumors circulated about them. Pettite and Clemens were two but both of those rumors were refuted. Pitchers gain little from steroid use and risk much. So few pitchers use them. Curt Schilling and Kenny Rogers are two other pitchers who's names have surfaced in rumors. There has been nothing to back these rumors however.  \n\nI personally suspect Schilling did try steroids. He matches the pattern for pitchers. Most pitchers caught using steroids have been pitchers on the edge. Guys who are in serious danger of no longer staying in Baseball. Schilling was blasted in his first couple years in the rotation and was shifted to the bullpen with less than spectacular results. Until he became a closer he was in real danger of being sent back to the minors. Then he got another shot at the rotation and a few years later learned how to pitch effectively.  Schilling had all the trademarks. Bullpen pitcher, bounced from team to team, in danger of being pushed out of baseball and getting up in the years to where he was no longer considered a real prospect. \n\nOther big names with credible evidence against them include Fred McGriff and Frank Thomas. \n\nLuis Gonzales is another name that's been rumored as a steroid user. Nothing hard in evidence has ever surfaced against him. He was a long time teamate of Caminitti and like Caminitti suddenly had break out offensive years in their early 30s. \n\nThe classical Steroid user changes are illustrated in Derek Lee's sudden fame. Gary Mathews is another. Both after being given up on by multiple teams, on the edge of being bounced out of Baseball suddenly have all "

7509,"Some technical elements:\n\n1) Use of deep focus - deep focus allowed the camera to see the background as sharply as the foreground. Welles made good use of this. \n\nFor example, in the scene where Susan tries to kill herself. Welles implies to us what she did in just one shot, because you can see the medicine bottle in the foreground, Susan lying down in the ""mid-ground"", and the locked door in the background; this all implies that she tried to kill herself. If Welles didn't use deep focus, such a shot (and such economy of shots) would be impossible.\n\n2) Jump cuts - you can see this in the scene where Kane says ""Merry Christmas"" to Thatcher, then it cuts to a scene many years later, where Thatcher says ""And a Happy New Year"".\n\nWelles used jump cuts creatively in this film, such as the example above. It is a joy to see how freshly he uses jump cuts (and other techniques) in this film, even though the movie is decades old.\n\nSome symbolism:\n\n1) When came walks past the hall of mirrors, I think the image shows us how many faces Kane had in his life, and which one is the real Kane? Who knows? \n\n2) When the smoke rises to the sky during the last shots of the movie, I think the shot is saying to us ""Look... Kane had so much possessions in his life... But so what? All of it is fleeting just like that smoke""."
7510,"Assuming you want to format (clear) the harddrive, the first thing you will need to do is create a boot disk.  Once you have the boot disc created you will beable to start the computer from the boot disc and then run the format program.\n\nMore specifically, if you have a windows disc (cd) you already have anything you need.  Simply pop in that cd, make sure the system starts from the cd drive (May have to alter BIOS settings to make this happen. Hitting f10 or some other key combination while the computer is starting will get you to the BIOS setting screen).  This should allow you to drop down to a dos prompt and from that prompt you can run the format. \n\nAlternately, if you have a windows cd or recovery cd, you could use it to do all the work for you.  Most of them will give you an option to do a destructive install which is basically a format and re-install of windows.  This might be the easiest option for you.\n\n\nHope this helps."

7584,"final drive for a 2000 is 4.4:1....this is on the type R heres some info\n\nSo how do we make a car that has a motor putting out such weak torque faster? That's when gears come in. Gears will multiply the torque by certain factors depending on their size/teeth count. Take a GS-R in first gear (3.23), when the motor spins 3.23 times, the driveshaft will turn once. And for every 4.4 turns of the driveshaft, the differential (final drive, 4.4) will turn once. That is directly connected to the axles which turn the wheels. You can simply multiply 3.23*4.4 to get an absolute gear ratio of 14.212:1. This means for every 14.212 turns of the motor the wheels will turn once. So if the motor gets to turn 14.212 times in order to only turn the wheels once, the amount of torque the motor is applying to the wheels gets multiplied that many times.\n\nif you were also asking for the 91 i dont have that info"

To be able to communicate effectively with ""the powers that be"", make sure all your language skills are up to snuff.\n\nThat being said - you started out by saying that ""I go to"" a vocational school, and somewhere in there, it changed to ""they kicked me out"". Which is it? Have you been expelled?\n\nIf so, you have several options, and the ACLU isn't one of the more useful ones, as it doesn't appear that your expulsion is the by-product of any of your civil rights being violated.\n\nStart by asking the administration of the school to provide you with a detailed record of your history there, including grades on all tests/exams, as well as attendance. Will this record show that you were completing the coursework successfully? Will it show that you were there when you were supposed to be, and that all assignments were submitted on time, and passing grades were given to them?\n\nThe point is, the school has to be able to show that you were expelled because of not meeting the criteria for passing. You cannot be expelled simply because you (and another student, if I am to understand this correctly), brought a potentially unsafe condition to the attention of the appropriate party there.\n\nIf, after reviewing your records, you determine that you did, indeed, meet the criteria for passing, then your next step would be to call and request a meeting with the school's administrator. Ask that person to put in writing their reason(s) for expelling you. Have your records in your hand, and ask the administrator to review them, to give them an opportunity to rescind their decision to expel you. If, after doing this, the administrator still doesn't agree that the expulsion was unwarrented, then your next step would be to contact the governing agency for the school, likely the Michigan Department of Education (at the state level). You can find their phone number in the pink government pages of your phone book. Call them, explain your situation, and ask for a hearing (or whatever process they have in place to appeal the school's decision), and follow through on it.\n\nBe calm, be articulate, be prepared, and be ready to defend your record. If you do all this, it is pretty likely that you will be re-admitted, and given the opportunity to catch up on whatever was missed since the expulsion, in order to pass.\n\nPicketing the school - while giving you the opportunity to vent your outrage - will not further your cause. Rethink that ""strategy""."

However, the giver doesn't have to pay taxes on that amount automatically. Instead, the amount is documented and added to any future gifts reported to the IRS. Once that amount hits $1 Million, then the IRS begins taxing it. Before then, nobody gets taxed on the gifts.\n\nThat's why the hubbub over the Estate Tax is such a joke (also called by some politicians the ""Death Tax.""). How many people do you know that will have $1 Million dollars to give to their heirs when they die (including any value of a home, for example)? I don't know too many.

7626,"What Does AJAX Stand For?\n\nAJAX means 'Asynchronous Javascript and XML'. Adaptive Path came up with the term in this essay: http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php. However, the word is really a bit of a misnomer: AJAX doesn't really rely on XML at all, but rather on a Javascript function that happens to be named XMLHttpRequest.\n\nAll About XMLHttpRequest.\n\nXMLHttpRequest was originally invented and implemented by a Microsoft team who were working on a webmail application, and it's been around for a while now (since 1999, in fact). The reason it has suddenly come to prominence now is that Google used it in three projects, Gmail, Google Suggest and Google Maps, and in each case managed to create a much better user interface than they would have been able to otherwise.\n\nSo what does XMLHttpRequest do? To put it simply, it lets your Javascript go back to the server, fetch some new content, and write it back out onto the page - all without the user having to change pages. This gives a 'smoother' feel to web applications, as they can do things like submit forms without the whole browser window needing to go blank and reload the page. Take a look at maps.google.com now, and notice how you can drag the map around anywhere you want to go without having to reload the page. This would be unthinkable without XMLHttpRequest.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons XMLHttpRequest has become popular now is that browsers other than Internet Explorer have started to support it, mainly due to the fuss over its use in Gmail. The function is, by all accounts, a very simple one in technical terms: it was just a matter of someone having the idea.\n\nGetting Started with AJAX.\n\nThe first thing to do to get started with AJAX, then, is to create an XMLHttpRequest object in your Javascript code. As ever, Internet Explorer has to be difficult, doing this a different way to every other browser out there. That means that you should use this Javascript code:\n\nvar ajax;\nonload = function () {\n   if (window.ActiveXObject) {\n      ajax = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");\n   }\n   else {\n      ajax = new XMLHttpRequest;\n   }\n}\n\nWhat you've done there is declared ajax as a global variable (usable by all functions), and then created a new AJAX object when the page loads, either using ActiveX for Internet Explorer or the XMLHttpRequest function in other browsers.\n\nThe next step is to write two more functions: one to get data from a URL, and one to handle the data that comes back.\n\nfunction getText(url) {\n   ajax.open(""GET"", url, true);\n   ajax.send(null);\n}\n\najax.onreadystatechange = function () {\n   if (ajax.status == ""200"") {\n   // do things with retrieved text (in ajax.responseText)\n   }\n}\n\nAll you need to do then is call getText from the relevant part of your code with a URL you want to get text from, and put that text wherever you want it to be in the state change function.\n\nThe most powerful thing about this approach is that the URL you send to the server can contain variables, using the old REST (question marks and equals signs) way of doing things.\n\nThat means that, using the code above, you can easily send a request to ajax.php on your server, and include the current value of, say, an input box for a username on a registration form. The ajax.php script checks whether that username is already in use, and then sends either '1' or '0' as its only output. All you would then need to do is check whether ajax.responseText was 1 or 0, and change the page accordingly, preferably using getElementByID.\n\nShould I Use It?\n\nThe question remains over just how useful this is: it's certainly good for some applications where users would otherwise have to submit data over and over again, but it's not much use for smaller ones. AJAX coding has a tendency to take a lot of time, especially the first time you try it, and this is "
7627,"typically you would want your result to be greater than the investment.  You can make an investment and have no results or negative results. You would calculate each separately.  The investment is whatever amount of money/time/labor you put into the project.  The result would be revenues or sales, number of people in attendance, increased awareness of a product, reduced costs, etc.  There can be lots of different results.  If you want to calculate ROI, then the investment and return have to be the same measure.  For example, the investment is $10,000 for an event sponsorship and you had 20 people attend the event.  Those 20 people each represent $1,000 worth of sales, so the return is $20,000 in sales.  The ROI is 20,000 divided by 10,000 or 200%."

If you have experience in another industry and want to switch industries, talk about how skills you used in your other jobs can be used in the job you are seeking (You should really research the job/industry you are trying to switch to so that you can really target the right skills and explain how you will add value).\nIf you are pursuing your first job ever, you should focus on demonstrating your character traits and how you've shown them in other arenas.  If you are hard-working, then you might want to talk about all of the organizations you held a leadership role in while in school, and your excellent GPA.  If you are an excellent communicator, talk about your grades in English, your work on the school newspaper.  \n\nIf you are in a position to do it, pursue an internship.  Most companies offer only college credit, but some do offer a small stipend. Internships are great because the employer knows that he/she will be getting mostly students with no work experience, and that's fine, because that is the point of an internship.\n\nSo, to sum this up...\nYou should begin your letter by introducing yourself and telling the employer what type/title of position you are seeking.  Then, explain why you want to work for their company and what you offer.  Highlight the skills you believe make you a great candidate.  Then, ask for an interview by either indicating that you have attached a resume for their consideration, or that you will be available for interview on (date) and can be reached by phone or email (include address)."

7762,"A glide bomb is an aerial bomb that is modified with aerodynamic surfaces to modify its flight path from a purely ballistic one, to a flatter, gliding, one. This extends the range between the launch aircraft and the target. Glide bombs are often fitted with control systems, allowing the controlling aircraft to direct the bomb to a pinpoint target.\n\nThe first glide bombs were developed by the Germans during World War II as an anti-shipping weapon. Ships are typically very difficult to attack: a direct hit is needed to do any serious damage, and hitting a target as small as a ship was difficult during WWII. The US felt the solution was massive fleets of bombers dropping a huge numbers of bombs, leading to the development of the B-17, but the Germans instead concentrated on making the bombing itself much more accurate. At first they used dive bombers with some success in this role, but their successes were countered by ever increasing anti-aircraft defenses placed on the Royal Navy ships they were attacking. By 1941 such attacks were still just as difficult as ever, but the added defenses made such attacks almost suicidal as well.\n\nThe German solution was the development of a number of radio controlled glide bombs. These were constructed by fitting a control package on the rear of an otherwise standard bomb, starting with their 100kg armor-piercing bomb to create the Ruhrstahl SD 1400, commonly referred to as the Fritz-X. The bomb aimer dropped the bomb while the aircraft was still approaching the ship, and guided it into an impact with the target by sending commands to spoilers attached to the rear of the bomb. This proved to be difficult to do, because as the bomb dropped toward the target it fell further behind the launch aircraft, eventually becoming difficult to see. In addition it proved difficult to properly guide the bomb to impact as the angle of descent changed, and if the bombadier didn't ""get it right"" and end up with the bomb roughly right over the target, there was little they could do at late stages to fix the problem.\n\nNevertheless the Fritz X proved useful once crews were trained on its use. In test drops from 8000m, experienced bomb aimers could place half the bombs within a 15m radius and 90% within 30m. Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Germany damaged the Italian battleship Italia and sank the Roma with Fritz X bombs. Attacks were also made on the USS Savannah, causing heavy damage, and on several transports off Anzio. HMS Warspite was also hit, had to be towed to Malta and was out of action for six months. Fritz X attacks also damaged the cruiser USS Philadelphia and sank the British light cruiser Spartan.\n\nA more useful weapon was the Henschel Hs 293, which fitted a set of small wings to the guidance system to flatten the trajectory and make the system easier to guide. On release a small liquid fueled rocket fired to speed up the weapon and get it out in front of the bomber, which was aimed to approach the target just off to one side. The bomb then dropped close to the water and glided in parallel to the launch aircraft, with the bomb aimer adjusting the flight left or right. As long as the bomb was dropped at roughly the right range so it didn't run out of altitude while gliding in, the system was easy to use.\n\nDesign work started as early as 1939, and a version of the guidance package mounted to standard 500kg bombs was tested in September 1940. It was found that the bomb was unable to penetrate a ships armor, so changes were made to fit an armor-piercing warhead before the system finally entered service in 1943. The basic A-1 model was the only one to be produced in any number, but developments included the B model with a custom armor-piercing warhead, and the C model with the conical warhead that was designed to hit the water short of the ship and then travel a short distance underwater to hit the ship under the waterline.\n\nThe Hs 293 was first used operationally"

As noted toward the beginning of this paper, the FLSA does not require employers to give breaks during the workday, but if breaks are given, certain rules apply. Rest or coffee breaks, defined as 20 minutes or less, are compensable hours worked under 29 C.F.R. 785.18, since they are regarded as being for the benefit of both the employer and the employee. Meal breaks, on the other hand, are not compensable, as long as they are at least 30 minutes in length and the employee is ""completely relieved from duty for the purpose of eating a regular meal"" (see 29 C.F.R. 785.19). Shorter meal breaks may be considered valid under special circumstances. The most frequent pitfall for employers is thinking that employees have true meal breaks if they are allowed to eat at their desks while answering phones, opening mail, sorting files, and so on. Such duties performed while trying to eat will render the time spent during the meal break compensable. Employers may control unauthorized work during meal breaks by the disciplinary process."

The way the current law is, the ones that are not implanted in a woman are discarded - thrown in the trash. I see this as unethical. Why discard them when they can be used on possibly life-saving research? Who supports stem-cell research? People as diverse as Michael J Fox, Nancy Reagan, Curt Shilling, and my father, who passed 4 years ago from Lou Gherigs disease.\n\nI feel it is unethical to discard something that could potentially save lives simply because of misinformation.\n\nPluripotent stem cells, those from embryos, are able to develop into all the different types of cells in the body and multiply rapidly. \n\nAdult stem cells, or multipotent stem cells, that could give rise to all cell and tissue types have not yet been found. Adult stem cells are often present in only minute quantities and can therefore be difficult to isolate and purify. There is also evidence that they may not have the same capacity to multiply as embryonic stem cells do. Also, adult stem cells may contain more DNA abnormalities—caused by sunlight, toxins, and errors in making more DNA copies during the course of a lifetime. These potential weaknesses limit the usefulness of adult stem cells.\n\nThere is a really good paper on this at The Michael J Fox Foundation website called ""Q&A Embryonic Stem Cells; Exploding the Myth"" (see link)"

And yes, it is one of the most over-used plots for cop shows.\n\nIn real life if you tried to follow up on anything especially a case that you were involved in prior to your suspension, you would find yourself in jail for obstruction of justice, or stalking the witness/suspects who got you in trouble in the first place. Additionally, you could be charged with carrying a concealed weapon, since you wouldn't have the right to do so off duty. Also, when you hand in your badge, even if it is for a suspension, you are told you have no police powers, so if you pulled a gun on someone or took them into custody or even said ""I am Officer (or Detective) _______"" you could be charged with impersonating a police officer. \nInternal Affairs may also assign a detective to keep an eye on you and make sure that you don't try to follow-up on anything and that if you do, they are there to put a stop to it and take you into custody. \nFinally, if the real criminal is someone in public office, what usually happens is the accused officer (or his attorney) can use the press to bring that person down. \n\nNow, what sometimes happens in ""real life"" to good cops who are falsely accused is:\nThey wait until their suspension is over, they gather up all the evidence possible, they either retire or leave the department, and then they write a book about what really happened. \nOr, if they are fired, they can write about it right away, unless there is some type order that stays in effect after the incident.\nOr, they can personally sue the public official or executive for damages, prove their innocence in civil court and get a nice fat settlement, then go on to write the book.\nMaking money from the incident can be far more satisfying than putting the executive or public official in jail."

7842,"Many great American statesmen have made the mistake of referring to our form of government as a Democracy. It was never intended to be a Democracy, but a democratic Republic. There are major differences. Still, ask any 100 people you meet on the street or any 100 students in America’s schools what form of government we have and you will likely get 100 responses of, “a Democracy.” \n\nJames Madison’s Federalist Paper #10 discusses the issue of Democracies. In it he states: “Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of Government, have erroneously supposed, that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions and their passions.” We can see from this that Mr. Madison would never have advocated a pure Democracy for his new nation. \n\nIn Federalist Paper #14 Madison wrote: “The true distinction between these forms...is, that in a Democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a Republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A Democracy consequently will be confined to a small spot. A Republic may be extended over a large region.” \n\nMadison continues in Federalist Paper #14 to describe a Republic thusly: “The effect [of having a Republic over a Democracy] (is to) enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice, will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good, than if pronounced by the people themselves convened for the purpose.” \n\nEssentially, a Democratic Republic is a limited government with enumerated powers (as specified in a Constitution) which is administered by persons elected by the people. These officials hold office at the pleasure of the electorate and must therefore strive to govern in a manner that is acceptable to the majority of voters. \n\nThe system breaks down when the electorate is misled by a biased news media or when special interests are able to manipulate the electoral process or, perhaps most significant, when the electorate no longer understands the working of the government and fails to exercise its proper oversight. For the system to function as our Founding Fathers envisioned it is necessary that the people understand the proper role of government as spelled out in our Constitution. It is not the function of government to ensure equality of outcomes. Any attempt to do so will eventually devolve into tyranny. \n\nConcerning this tendency, in 1792, James Madison wrote in regards to property rights: “Government is instituted to protect property of every sort....This being the end of government....That is NOT a just government...nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has...is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest.” \n\nThe socialistic nature of our present-day government would have been abhorrent to Madison and the other Founding Fathers. Government’s function should not be to level the people to an equal mediocrity, but to ensure a level playing field upon which added effort or superior talent results in increased reward. That is the philosophy that built America and made it great."

Produced by Klasky Csupo Inc. (the creators of the Rugrats media franchise), and created by Emily Kapnek, the show revolves around the life of Ginger Foutley, a typical junior high school student who lives in a fictional Connecticut community named Sheltered Shrubs. The show is unique, in that many of the characters have actual wardrobes (to save time and money most cartoon characters are almost always drawn wearing the same outfit).\n\nCharacters\nGinger Foutley (Melissa Disney), the main character, talented poet (there are two episodes that deal with poems she's written) and diary keeper (she's often seen writing in it), \n\nDeidre Hortense ""Dodie"" Bishop (Aspen Miller) and Macie Lightfoot (Jackie Harris), Ginger's two slightly dorky best friends, \n\nCourtney Gripling (Liz Georges), their rich and arrogant classmate who has been hanging out with Ginger. Courtney completely disappeared during the high school episodes. \n\nMiranda Killgallen (Cree Summer), who has been doing things to keep Courtney and Ginger apart (in the very first episode, she even has her arrested for stealing, after she recommended Ginger to do so for Courtney's birthday party). \n\nCarl Foutley (Jeannie Elias) and Robert Joseph ""Hoodsey"" Bishop (Tress MacNeille), Ginger and Dodie's younger brothers respectively, who tend to do weird things that are, most of the time, a given episode's subplot (for example, running a lunch cart), \n\nBlake Gripling (Kath Soucie), Courtney's younger brother, who occasionally tags along with Carl and Hoodsey, \n\nLois Foutley (Laraine Newman), Ginger's divorced mother, who works as a late shift nurse at a local hospital, \n\nDarren Patterson (Kenny Blank), Ginger's next door neighbor, who later becomes her boyfriend. \n\nalso, i love hey! arnold. and spongebob squarepants, and anime like boys be, gto, gundam wing among MANY others"

7960,"Well, there are two different topics here:\n\n1) The music creation / artistic part of making music\n2) The music business itself (i.e., lawyers, labels,\ncontracts, profits, royalties, paychecks, etc).\n\nWell, obviously, creating the music is the rewarding part emotionally.  You get to create something from your imagination and also something that reflects your personality and give it to public listening.  This is the part that is also the most fun portion.  It should not be tied down by business rules.  But, in many cases it is.\n\nThe music business is, as is all other money making industries, just a business solely interested in making money.  So, as long as the music is popular and it continues to make money, that artist is at the top.  If that stops, then the artist becomes a has-been.  If the artist was industry created (like so many artists of today), then that person becomes a nobody as fast as they became a somebody.  Today, the music business is almost solely focused on piracy without regard to anything else.  They are so entranced by this issue that they have forgotten that they really need to provide quality music to the listening public.\n\nSo, because of the piracy issue, the music of today is really not that great.  Much of today's music is primarily created in the producer's mind and by the producers... hiring people solely to fill the roles (just as as a film might hire an actor).  In the past, a group of musicians would get together and create music and then be discovered.  Today, it's just the opposite.  Producers create the music up front and then find someone with the look and a reasonably decent voice to fill the role.  Rarely is commercial pop music actually created by talented musicians.  It's now almost solely created by a producer who then hires musicians to play the music to what was already written (requiring only musical instrument skill, but little, if any, writing talent).\n\nThe contractual part of the music industry is where most new artists get bitten hard.  If you're undiscovered, then they rope you in to signing a horrible contract with small amount of pay and lots of concert work.  So, you get little in the way of pay, but you do a lot of work for them (that you are contractually obligated to provide).  So, if you ever get into the position of signing a record contract, be careful to read the verbiage exactly (and have a lawyer that you have hired go over it with you).  Don't blindly sign it simply because you want a record deal."

This adds up when you include header files and other executables to your main program.\n\nHaving worked professionally in both environments, I can say that maintaining someone else's code in VB or any OO is far easier to read than doing the same in someone else's C code, especially in very large programs."

USA culture tends to like the Lone Ranger mentality – or is a throw away society.\n - Create something new.\n - Looks new and clean (at least initially)\n - Excitement of something new.\n\n* Clean Sheet Cons\n - Need to look at any legal requirements that may not have impacted an existing organization.\n - May not learn from the past or from mistakes that have been previously made.\n - May not have expertise in all areas that will be needed.  Easy to miss something important.\n\n* Systematic Design Pros\n - Build on what has been learned before.\n - Usually appears cheaper on the surface, however, tens to fail to live up the promise once the changes start to occur.\n - Get to fix what is wrong!  USA culture tends to like the Lone Ranger mentality – or is a throw away society.\n- Work with familiar surroundings and just modify what is there.\n\n* Systematic Design Cons\n - If anything is wrong with the current structure or organization, then legal consequences may result for the management team (i.e. if there is any hazardous waste found on the property, top managers can go to jail).\n - Work with familiar surroundings and just modify what is there.\n - Changing the metal attitudes or culture of the organization can be very hard and time consuming.\n - Is it that people do not like change, or that people do not like forced change!\n\n\nOne of many examples that you could look at this why a management team of a manufacturing organization chooses to either build a new plant in an area where there has never been a manufacturing site before (Clean Sheet – sometimes called Green Site) versus the remodeling of an existing plant to make some product.\n\nYou can search on various web sites to see how some companies have approach this concept.  While some will rebuild existing structures, others may want to set up a entirely new facility in a new area that has not had manufacturing before.\n\n\nOther areas that you can look for information on this question include: Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, Toyota Production System (TPD), Ford Production System (FPD), Kaizen, changing culture or behavior topics or instruction system design within the training community. \n\nGood Luck"

THEN I would have an aisle with nothing but fish aquariums and fishy stuff like the tunnels and the rocks and the food. Then on the other side of the fishy shelves I would have the stuff for the reptiles the aquariums the toys and food that you would have for the reptiles. The next aisle I would have birdy cages and birdy toys and on the other side of the shelf stock the birdy food and birdy treats. OF course have your departments clearly marked with a brightly colored sign with the name of the animal that the department is for and have a nice picture of that kind of animal on the sign all different breeds. Okay now next to the birdy stuff, you have stuff for the rodents, the bunnies and the mice and gerbils and one side you have the cages and accessories and the next side you have their food. \n\nNow for the kittycats.  One side you have their pillows and beds and their accessories such as collars and the next side, you will have the food and their litterboxes and the same with the doggies and on each endcap, you should have magazines and books about each animal. NOW if you want to have stuff for barnyard animals that should be a whole separate department. You should have that in the back of the store, it should be designed like the gardening dept at places like walmart target and so on. The reason I say that is I automatically associate that with outdoors and barnyard animals as a rule are outdoor pets. There you would have the feeding tubs and so on and so forth, their food their hay. \n\nOh Yes and the inside of the store.

THe blue will mellow out the red and yellow adds a happy tone to it, but you don't want to use too much red or too much yellow. You want to even everything out. \n\nThe name of your store should be: Paws and Claws Pet Supply.  IT should be called Happy Tails Pet Supply\n\nYou can advertise with those lil mail flyers to start with and offer various promos such as buy any bag of cat/dog food and get any size free or something like that. \nOffer free pet toys on the first visit\nOf course if it is not too expensive, get your own little newspaper going and put it in the Sunday papers you know liek petsmart has their own. \n\nOh Yes and the thing that people eat up is when they are allowed to take their pets shopping with them and around Christmas time Santa gets to come into the store so the pets can visit him. \n\nGunther helped me out with this."

Any one can gain firearm experience as a civilian, but when comparing a small arms aficionado to a professional soldier who has years of experience around firearms, the civilian is gonna lose the pick.\n You can always join some rag tag militia in a third world country who will take anyone who is willing to pick up an AK-47 and get paid with heroin and call yourselves 'mercenaries', and that's if they allow you to live if you are Western.\n The ONLY possibility I can give you, is if you have expert medical schooling.  Basic medical knowlege might not do because most soldiers receive that during their years in service. If you are a doctor or surgeon, the chances are good you can go ANYWHERE in the world.\n  You also have the possibility of become a police officer trainer in foreign countries, much like we have in Iraq training their police. But, of course, you need to get that certification here in the states before applying for those positions.

Generally these off-lease printers have been refurbished.  The cost of the print cartridges may be a bit high - but you will get the quality that you want.\n\n2nd - OkiData makes a high quality new printer that can print 11x17 - but the new ones start at about $4,000.  You may be able to find a late model off-lease printer.\n\n3rd - Having been in the quick print industry for over 16 years - I have worked with hundreds of artist that need high quality for low cost.  Take advantage of your local (not Kinko's - loved em but they go after the big buck clients) OfficeMax, OfficeDepot or Staples - and if you go to Depot or Max mention that Staples has a sale price of .39 per 8.5 x 11 and will they match that - it is their policy to match a competitors price.  This is a good solution if you are looking to make proofs or examples to show the client.  Additionally all of the above mentioned companies have the ability to receive your files via e-mail.  Give them some time to produce it (like at least 4 hours to work it in to their production schedule - or ask what their turn time is) trust me if you build a good relaitonship with them they will take care of you.\nGood luck!"

He doesn't inspire at all cos he doesn't have pace, can't dribble, can't tackle and is basically good for nothing except sending in curling shots and crosses. \n\nGerrard can do much more. He can take the free kicks well, maybe not as well as Beckham but already excellent. He can shoot from distance from open play - just look at how many times he has scored. He can defend as well.\n\nAnd most importantly, he can inspire and commands tremendous amounts of respect from all those around him: just look at last year's Champs League finals against AC Milan and this year's FA Cup finals against West Ham. Look at how he rallied Liverpool to come back from 3 and 2 goals down respectively, and ultimately triumph on penalties. This is definitely good enough testimony to prove Gerrard's worth to England. For that, he should be made captain.\n\nWell, as for Beckham, how many times has he inspired victories? Furthermore he's been fluctuating drastically in form ever since he moved to Madrid. Even before the move, he was playing terribly at Man Utd. In fact, he was quite useless at Utd but just had to be fielded cos he was captain.\n\nSo lesson to learn is, ditch Beckham as captain of England so that he need not play!\n\nLet Gerrard wear the armband and lead England to the World Cup!"

8237,"Be sure to include the fact -- which I am sure is a fact -- that their progress is largely dependent upon how quickly and how well they learn English.  \n\nBlacks, of course, have grown up around English, but lately there has been a movement to emphasize rather than diminish their language differences with standard English.  I believe this is a mistake.  I also believe it is being fostered by people who have hidden political and even criminal agendas: the gangs seem to love to be incomprehensible to ""the straights.""  \n\nFor the rest, learning English is usually high on their agenda anyway.  Most of it has to do with not letting your pride get in the way of your learning: someone tells you how to pronounce something properly, say, ""Yes, thank you,"" and pronounce it the way they just did.  Two or three times.  You are memorizing it.\n\nEducation more generally is also terribly important, but it will not go well until you learn English to the point where you are not handicapped in an all-English speaking classroom.  So most people who come here from elsewhere know that they must knuckle down and study.  American Blacks also seem to be getting that point.  Being citizens, however, they have another option:  they can enlist in the military, and let them pay for their education.\n\nGood luck with your essay.  I am fascinated by the process of immigration: see my avatar?  I take that kind of thing seriously as being one of the major ways we get new Americans.  Notice how old our population is growing, Baby Boomers becoming senior citizens.  This country needs fresh blood, fresh ideas, fresh energy.  We get some in our children, and some in our immigrants."

8245,"It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs."

The poorest they are, the more the kids (I'll let you think about the consequences).\n4) All the western civilized countries are under an invasion they are not ready to afford (In the sense that whatever policy they adopt is not right simply because the sole strategy to adopt, i.e. kicking them all off, would be considered inhuman by other countries).\n5) When countries will begin to react to this massive invasion, in many cases it will be too late, as the amount of immigrates of a certain religion or racial group would be such that kicking them away will be impossible.\n6) Sooner or later they will begin to organize themselves into political or pressure groups, which with money or media will affect all decisions of your government."

But, last year that wasn't such a big deal, because a lot of people predicted him to win it.  This year, it's a little trickier and will depend a lot on what situations players end up in.  Brandon Roy is the most NBA ready, which gives him a clear advantage.  Adam Morrison is competitive and intense enough to put up big numbers in the right situation.  Randy Foye or Rudy Gay are in the same boat.  \n\nI'm going to say that Brandon Roy wins rookie of the year. In my mock draft, I have him getting traded to Houston for Shelden Williams (8th pick) and Luther Head (that's a big rumor that's floating around). Roy would be the third option there, which would be ideal for his skill set.  He'll be used in a variety of different ways and should get a lot of open looks with Ming and T-Mac commanding much of the attention."

8325,"Zinedine Zidane, Soccer Player \n\nBorn: 23 June 1972 \nBirthplace: Marseille, France \nBest Known As: The MVP of World Cup 1998 \nA flashy midfielder, Zinedine Zidane won the Golden Ball as the most valuable player in the World Cups of 1998 and 2006. Zidane played his first professional First Division game for Cannes in 1991 and quickly rose through the professional ranks. He sealed his reputation by scoring two goals in the World Cup finals of 1998, helping France defeat Brazil to claim its first-ever World Cup championship. Zidane played for professional powerhouse Juventus from 1996 until 2001, when he was acquired by Real Madrid for 46 million pounds, a record fee. (By 2003 his teammates on Real Madrid included superstars David Beckham, Luis Figo and Ronaldo, among others.) Zidane was named FIFA player of the year in 1998, 2000, and 2003. He retired from professional soccer after leading France to the finals of the 2006 World Cup.\n\nZidane's nickname is ""Zizou""... In his final game, the 2006 World Cup final against Italy, Zidane was red-carded out of the game for a bizarre headbutt to the chest of Italy's Marco Materazzi. Italy won the game and the World Cup on penalty kicks after a 1-1 draw. However, Zidane was still named the tournament's most outstanding player. He claimed he hit Materazzi in retaliation for insults made about Zidane's mother and sister; in September 2006 Materazzi said he had grabbed Zidane's shirt during play, causing Zidane to remark that he would give him the shirt if he liked it so much, in turn prompting Materazzi to respond, ""I'd rather have your sister."" Materazzi further claimed he didn't know Zidane had a sister until after the incident."

The ages are getting darker and darker. And I wanted to share with you the following facts: If you agree with me please send them to as many friends of you as possible... \n\nThe transnational companies which are using American government and ARMY to sip oil from Iraq are paying back with some of the money they have earned by selling the oil they have been continuously stealing from Iraq. They will do the same in Iran and Venezuella.\n\nYou won't believe it but some transnational companies are there to force the Yahoo Corp. to delete my questions here. But I am continuously changing my name to hide it from them. Until they find me, thousands of people will have learned that America is no more controlled by its national companies. Transnational companies are a great threat both for America and the world. A transnational company is one that feels no loyalty to any nation. They don’t pay any taxes to any government and they are strong enough to overthrow governments all over the world. For the time being they are using Americans. They threat America by the fact that if they draw their capital and investments from America 25 % of its population will be jobless. \n\nThe fight and the tension between the members of the Senate is in fact a fight between the American and non-American capital owners. Right after the 9/11 the nationalistic or loyal American capital owners became a little bit stronger and passed a decree from the senate to the effect that the central government and the states are to buy their weapons from NATIONAL war industries... But at present non-American capital owners have become stronger enough to sip petroleum out of Iraq by using American ARMY. This is the horrible fact about American Politics and Bush is not loyal to America.\n\nSorry for the terrible English. Wish you prosperity and happiness.

This is just a preliminary to see if;\n1.       You can swim\n2.       If you panic\n3.       How much heart you have.\n\nIt does not qualify you for anything, other than a second look.\nBUDS candidates are a fairly select group of people, gleened from a much larger school of tadpoles, but even they get thinned out significantly. As a group these guys, contrary to movies, already tend to be highly intelligent though (this is not determined by an ASVAB but by a process) and have an incredible amount of perserverance, guts and determination. The process is designed to weed out those that think like individuals, don't take direction exactly (also what bootcamp does), and can reach into thier gut and find strength when they don't have the steam for more abuse. This is only BUDS, these folks are not neccesarily SEALS, From my point of view, these folks are more than remarkable, my hat is off to them.\n\nIf this is something your looking at doing, the entire military, and the Navy especially (Don't let a jarhead, air force puke, grunt, or a beach comber Coastie tell you different.), is a good life and offers opportunities you can't get anywhere else on the planet. I wish you success in your endeavor."

8450,"Sunni Muslims are the largest denomination of Islam. They are referred to as Ahl ul-Sunna (Arabic: أهل السنة), the folks of the tradition. The word Sunni comes from the word sunna (Arabic : سنة ) which means the tradition of the prophet of Islam Muhammad.\n\nShi'a Islam or Shi`ism (from the Arabic word شيعة, Persian: شیعه) is the second largest denomination of the religion of Islam. Shi'a Muslims adhere to the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his Ahlul Bayt (family). Thus, Shi'as reject the rule of the initial three Sunni Caliphs as Sunnis reject the Imamate of the Shi'a Imams. The singular/adjective form is shi`i (Arabic: شيعي.) and refers to a supporter of the Ahlul Bayt and of Ali ibn Abi Talib (Imam Ali) in particular.\n\nSome thirty years after Muhammad's death, the Islamic community plunged into the First Islamic civil war. This civil war led to the emergence of three distinct Islamic groups:\n\nSunnis - Sunnis regard the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman, and Ali) as Rightly Guided Caliphs, that is, caliphs who ruled in accordance with the Qur'an and the sunnah, or way of Muhammad and Sunni reject the Shia Imams. Sunnis believe that most of the succeeding caliphs failed to live up to these standards. In spite of these failures on the part of the secular leadership, the Sunni clergy (the ulema) counseled believers to submit to the authorities; this was better than constant community strife. The full name of the Sunni branch is Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jama'ah. \nShi'a - Shi'a regard Imam Ali as the first Imam and generally reject the first three sunni's caliphates, believing that his was the only ""Rightly Guided"" caliphate, and that only the Imams of the household and descendants of Muhammad have the right to rule. Shi'as and a handful of Sunni scholars accepted Hasan ibn Ali's claim as caliph, though historical consensus states that Hasan Have ruled for six months.The Salafis (or the Early Muslims), do not accept the Shi'a as Muslims. \n\nThis was the third group:\n\nKhwarij, or Kharijites - The Khwarij were initially loyal to Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth caliph, but turned against him after he accepted arbitration during the First Islamic civil war. Because the Khwarij had a very narrow view of what constitutes kufr (acts that invalidate one's Islam), they quickly split up into sects within themselves, each accusing one another of having fallen into disbelief. Though one branch of the Khwarij survives in Yemen and Oman as the Ibadi denomination of Islam, Khwarij doctrine has been largely rejected and relegated to the history books. \nOther divisions have arisen since the civil war of the 7th century CE. Some groups are now extinct. Of the existing groups, Sunni Muslims do not accept members of the Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Zikri as fellow Muslims."

8468,"All right, I'm not going to look at what he has done so far this season.... because it's just easier to figure out that way.  \n\nHe's played in 2125 games, which would amount to about 14 seasons if he were to play 155 games each year.  He's actually in his 18th season, so you got to figure he's basically missed three years of playing time (remember, I'm not counting this season, so he's played 17 complete seasons).  \n\nHis home run total coming into the season was 536, which over 14 seasons of playing time averages out to 38 home runs per year.  If you take that average over the three seasons that he missed, it would come out to 114.  So, theoretically, he should have been at about 650 coming into this season, which with his 12 so far this year would put him at 662, and on pace for about 688 by the end of this season.  \n\nHowever, he was at 398 before coming to Cincinnati.  In his last four years in Seattle, he was averaging 52 per season.  He's in Cincy for his 7th season this year.  If he doesn't get injured and even averages 45 HR/season, he'd be looking at 713 at the end of this season.\n\nAs if this isn't way too much already, another way of looking at it - \nHe has averaged 3.7 AB/G, and a 14.68 HRR (home run ratio - the number of AB's between each HR).  If he played 155 games per season, he would have 2635 games, and 9750 AB's, which would translate into 664 HR's at the beginning of this season, and 703 at the end of this season."

You may want to chat with your internet provider to make sure that at you do not have problem with your internet connection.\n\nIf they already confirm that there's no problem with the internet connection then II have a feeling that your computer has been infected by virus or spyware.  A few tips as follows:\n1. Run virus and spyware scans from safe mode (restart the computer and press F8 button several times until the option menu appear).\n2. Reinstall IE from the OS CD\n\nIf these basic steps did not fix the problem then you will need to reformat your HDD since the OS has been compromised very badly and this problem is just the tip of the iceberg.  You will need to back-up your datafiles and e-mails (if using Outlook).  Then reformat your HDD and reinstall the OS & programs.  This steps will make sure that there are no bugs and problems with the operating system anymore.  Just make sure you have the OS and drivers CD ready, since formatting will ERASE EVERYTHING in your HDD.\n\nHope this helps.  Good Luck!"

Yes, Tomlinson is on fire, but if the Chargers offense is anything it's versatile, they won't stick with the run if it isn't working.  And Rivers is not in a slump, GoMichigan doesn't know what he's talking about, Rivers threw for 337 yards and 3 TD's with no ints last week, and he was an offensive player of the week nominee.

Because it applies to that countries citizens. \n\nIf a constitution of one country applied to all the citizen of the world, the rest of the countries would not need a constitution.\n \nWe can not go to Mexico and demonstrate because it is against the Mexican constitution. You are subject to jail time of between 3-5 years. Even if you become a naturalize citizen of Mexico you still may not demonstrate against the government of Mexico. Under Mexico's constitution the only citizens that may demonstrate against the Mexican government are born citizens.\n\nYou know I have nothing against people that want to become citizens of our country, but to come into the country without the proper documentation is not right.\n\nWhy are people coming to America? Because they can't do in their country what they can do in America and they know that.  People think it is all about the jobs and in most cases it is, but therea re other things also.\n\nMost people from other countries don't have the freedoms we have here. The country they come from have a corrupt government with the people in power getting rich and richer, taking bribes and not helping the people of their country. They can not own cars, houses, stay out late at night  nor attend the school of their choice.\n\nThis might seem trivial to most of you, but it is a big thing when you are not allowed to do them in your country.\n\nWhen you are reading the constitution at least make sure that it makes logical sense. \n\nYou do not write a constitution for other countries and their citizens nor do other countries write a constitution about our country and the citizens here in the United. States.\n\nI hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.\n\n""FIGHT ON"""

Contact each of your debtors, tell them your situation and then tell them how much you can pay them each month.  Most companies are willing to work with you when it comes to repayment.  If there are interest rates involved, ask that the interest rates be reduced while you try to pay the money back.  In the long run, this is a far better solution than incurring more debt."

8556,"The fire combined with major structural damage caused the collapse.  The fire was obviously initiated by the jet fuel, but was further sustained by combustible objects in the building.\n\nWhile it is not frequently discussed, the Twin Towers were rare in that their outer walls were structural (load-bearing).  Typically, buildings have widely spaced columns.  This type of design was heavily dependent of on the steel floor truss systems to distribute the load.  As the fire weakened (important note - not melted) the floor trusses, the vertical members gave way to excessive loading caused by a failure to distribute the loads.\n\nThe excessive weight above the points of weakening caused a rapid, catastrophic failure - observed as pancaking of the floors below the initial point of failure.  \n\nIt has been argued that because the building fell at free-fall speeds, which is largely accurate, it could not have possibly been failure of members due to vertical loading.  However, consider the sheer weight and momentum applied to each floor as the one above it fails.  These are extreme values that no building could withstand."
8557,"I think that whatever happens in the host's house should be the host's responsibility, but whatever happens after the guests leave the host's driveway, is the sole responsibility of the persons involved- not the host of the house they just left. If everything becomes the host's responsibility, then a whole new can of worms will be opened and then to what extent, how much, when, and what happened has to be defined and it becomes too complicated for anyone to resolve whose responsibility it is. When it comes to drinking, the same applies for in house rules (especially under-age drinking) but after the guests leave, drunk or sober, it is their responsibility. EXAMPLE: If I leave a bar or restaurant and I had a few drinks and drive home drunk and crash into another car, is the bartender/waiter responsible for what happened because I drank at their place? No. People need to learn to become more responsible for their actions. Too many loop-holes and laws are being made that allow for people to do as they please b/c it is not their fault.

8560,"Only as a road map, not necessarily to be followed.\n\nIn my experience with business plans, their main benefit is to help you think through the business before you start. It forces you to research the market, to know what to expect, the obstacles you will face. It is one thing to say ""I want to start a clothing store"" and another to be confronted with the realities of how to find manufacturers, how to get your clothing line to the stores, how will you compete, the question of production, the finances you  will need, etc.\n\nThe trouble with business plan stems from the assumptions you will make -- especially in the financial section. One of the common mistakes of entrepreneurs is to depict a very rosy prospect for their business -- which is fine, if it is true. They think they will sell this much; they think they can accomplish this much; they think they can do all the marketing plans they've thought of; they think that they can get the financing they want. Then they start the business and find that the demand for their products is not what they anticipated; hence their revenue and sales figures fall short of what they assumed in the business plan. \n\nBusiness plans end up useless because of the erroneous assumptions made. More so with a dynamic, changeable business.\n\nDo a business plan mainly for the purpose of getting financing."

8587,"Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (Arabic: أبومصعب الزرقاوي‎) (c. October 1966 – June 7, 2006) was a Salafi Muslim terrorist leader and the self-proclaimed leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. One or more individuals identifying themselves as Zarqawi took responsibility, on several audiotapes, for numerous acts of terrorism in Iraq, including the killing of many civilians and the taking of hostages. He was also allegedly responsible for many other acts of violence, including the beheading of hostages (possibly including Nick Berg) in Iraq.\n\nAs an Islamist identified with the Salafi movement of Wahhabism, Zarqawi opposed the presence of American and Western military forces in the Islamic world and opposed the West's support for Israel. In September 2005, he reportedly declared ""all-out war"" on Shia Muslims in Iraq,[1] and is believed responsible for dispatching numerous Al-Qaeda suicide bombers throughout Iraq, and especially to areas with large concentrations of Shia civilians. As the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq he is suspected of causing thousands of people's deaths--many if not most of them civilians.\n\nZarqawi, a longtime ally of Osama bin Laden, was a high-ranking member of bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, and since October 2004 had referred to his own organization Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, or Monotheism and Holy War Group, an insurgent network operating in Iraq, as ""Al-Qaeda in Iraq"". On October 21, 2004, Zarqawi officially announced his allegiance to Al Qaeda; on December 27, 2004, Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape of bin Laden calling Zarqawi ""the prince of al Qaeda in Iraq"" and asked ""all our organization brethren to listen to him and obey him in his good deeds.""[2]\n\nZarqawi was the most wanted man in Jordan and Iraq,[3] having participated in or masterminded a number of violent actions against United States, Jordanian and Iraqi targets. The U.S. government offered a USD $25 million reward for information leading to his capture, the same amount offered for the capture of bin Laden before March 2004. On October 15, 2004, the U.S. State Department added Zarqawi and the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal Jihad group to its ""list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations"" and ordered a freeze on any assets that the group might have in the United States. On February 24, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice's FBI also added al-Zarqawi to the ""Seeking Information – War on Terrorism"" list, the first time that he had ever been added to any of the FBI's three major ""wanted"" lists.[4]\n\nZarqawi was killed in Baquba by a United States airstrike on June 7, 2006"

8620,"Le Comptoir\n37 rue Berger, 1st (01.40.26.26.66). M° Les Halles. \nOpen noon-2am Mon-Thur, Sun; noon-3am Fri, Sat. \nCredit MC, V. \n\nAmid the busy commerce of Les Halles, Le Comptoir is an oasis of calm overlooking the gardens behind St-Eustache church. The decor is Moroccan to the last detail: deep-red rugs, coloured-glass chandeliers, low-slung leather stools and banquettes piled high with cushions. A young, worldly crowd lounges around drinking thé à la menthe - served as it should be with pine nuts bobbing on top. Friendly service and a lethal selection of cocktails make a perfect spot for leisurely drinking. Attractive Franco-Moroccan menu, too.\n\nLe Fumoir\n6 rue de l’Amiral-de-Coligny, 1st (01.42.92.00.24). M° Louvre Rivoli. \nOpen 11am-2am daily. Closed 2wks Aug. \nCredit AmEx, MC, V. \n\nThis elegant bar directly opposite the Louvre has now become a bit of a Parisian institution: inside neo-colonial fans whirr lazily, oil paintings adorn the walls and even the bar staff seem to have been included in the interior decorator’s sketches. A sleek crowd sipping Martinis or browsing the papers at the long mahogany bar (originally from a Chicago speakeasy) gives way to young professionals in the restaurant and pretty young things in the library. It can feel a little try-hard and well-behaved, but some expertly mixed cocktails and a little friendly flirting with the PRs on the prowl are guaranteed to take the edge off the evening. \n\nHemingway Bar at the Ritz\nThe Ritz, 15 pl Vend? 1st (01.33.43.16.30.30). M? Madeleine or Concorde. \nOpen 6.30pm-2am Tue-Sat. Closed 3wks Aug. \nCredit AmEx, DC, MC, V. \n\nThis much lauded bar has become a cocktailers’ cliché, but that’s because it’s simply one of the loveliest places in Paris to do drinkies. The dark wood, muffled laughter, black-and-white photos of Papa H and the old-school charm of Colin the head barman and lovely Ludo his second, make the bar a cocoon from the horrors of the outside world. Leather seating and five-star service (a glass of berry-scented water appears within 30 seconds of arrival) preface cocktails are as near to alcoholic nirvana as possible - not least the divine raspberry Martini. Pulling in its fair share of characters, honeymooners and expense-account nerds, it’s also a wonderful place to see what the human race does in its spare time. Opened across the corridor is the Cambon Bar: the original Ritz bar, done up as it was back in its ’20s heyday.\n\nKong\n1 rue du Pont-Neuf, 1st (01.40.39.09.00). M° Pont Neuf. \nOpen noon-2am Mon-Sat. \nCredit AmEx, MC, V. \n\nPhilippe Starck’s latest addition to the Paris scene is, predictably, one of the city’s hottest places to do cocktails, ideally located on the top two floors of the Kenzo building overlooking the Pont Neuf. The bright mishmash interior is manga-inspired with lots of neon, Hello Kitty knick-knacks, comfy grey leather sofas and rocking chairs at the main dining tables, best avoided after a few too many coupes. The best bet is to perch at the long bar, flirt with the too-beautiful-to-bartend staff and order an excellent vodkatini or three. After dark you can make a music suggestion with each order - at weekends they somehow carve out a tiny dancing space for the trendy crowd to strut their stuff on. Wear lots of labels and try your best to look cool while half-cut. \n\n\nLe Couvent\n69 rue Broca, 13th (01.43.31.28.28). M° Les Gobelins. \nOpen 9am-2am Mon-Fri; 6pm-2am Sat. \nCredit MC, V. \n\nFor an address located in the middle of nowhere, this heavily beamed bar creates a delightful hideaway. It first appeared in Pierre Gripari’s two-part short-story collection Contes de la rue Broca, but it has come a long way since those dingy days. Nowadays it’s the chouchou of students and thirtysomething couples, especially at concert time when live chords get feet tapping. Always busy, always smoky. \n\nRhubarb\n18 rue Laplace, 5th (01.43.25.35.03). M° Maubert Mutualité. \nOpen "

I also am not a micro manager, preferring to allow people to work at their own pace to keep morale up however there are times this doesn't work either.  If all your staff are not following your directives, I would have a staff meeting and in your own words explain the problem you  are having and allow for some professional feedback for your staff.  Remind them that failure to follow their supervisor's directives is insubordination and can result in discipline.  Say you don't want to go this route but if productivity does not improve and directives are not followed, you will have no choice but to do so.  Now if it is an individual or a few individuals, I would meet with them privately (always have a witness though since some staff will exxagerate)and go over the need for teamwork and the above information.  Explain that you are willing to listen to suggestions but directives need to be completed in a timely manner.  I don't order either and my program runs extremely well with a few glitches here and there.  My seasoned staff will tell the problem staff that I am very nice and fair but she does not play when it comes to work and that may be the type of boss you are as well, just needing to toughen up a little.  I never order and I personally resent when people give me orders so I try to show staff respect at all times.  It takes time, but you can correct the problems you are having.  My quess is you have some staff that really like you and just need a little direction.  You may also have some staff who think they can do the job better and therefor will continue to ignore you.  If you earn the respect of your stronger staff, they can help keep the problem staff in line.  And if not, they will understand that the problem staff need to be disciplined.

8717,"In computer architecture, 64-bit is an adjective used to describe integers, memory addresses or other data units that are at most 64 bits (8 octets) wide, or to describe CPU and ALU architectures based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size.\n\n\nAs of 2004, 64-bit CPUs are common in servers, and have recently been introduced to the (previously 32-bit) mainstream personal computer arena in the form of the AMD64, EM64T, and PowerPC 970 (or ""G5"") processor architectures.\n\nAlthough a CPU may be 64-bit internally, its external data bus or address bus may have a different size, either larger or smaller, and the term is often used to describe the size of these buses as well. For instance, many current machines with 32-bit processors use 64-bit buses (e.g. the original Pentium and later CPUs), and may occasionally be referred to as ""64-bit"" for this reason. The term may also refer to the size of an instruction in the computer's instruction set or to any other item of data (e.g. 64-bit double-precision floating-point quantities are common). Without further qualification, however, a computer architecture described as ""64-bit"" generally has integer registers that are 64 bits wide and thus directly supports dealing both internally and externally with 64-bit ""chunks"" of integer data."

8771,"Interesting question Pharos91. \n\nOn the face of it you could just pick and age like 70, 80, 90, etc. But it isn't quite as simple as that. The majority of people die when they are old but few actually die of old age. Most die of an illness or disease of some description and that is not the same as dying of old age. \n\nAs an example. My two grandmothers both died at an old age. One had suffered a heart condition for thirty years and finally died age 96. She died as the result of a heart attack. The other simply went to sleep one night and never woke up again. She was 101. There was no evidence of any medical condition, her organism had nothing left to give and merely  quit working. She died of old age.\n\nSo, in answer to your question. A person dies of old age when the body has used up all of its resources and the organism ceases to function of its own accord. And since that will depend on what resources there were to start with, you can't simply apply a label like 70, 80 or 90."

8814,"Hi L,\n\nThis is a topic that I have studied in much detail over the past 3 years. There are ALOT of ways to make money online, however, the moment you log on to the internet you are bombarded by ALOT of different sites telling you how to make money and that you`ll be a millionaire overnight. It takes time to filter out the crap from the genuine income generating programs. \n\nI have researched literally thousands of the different offers I'm sure you see every day on the internet. You could spend a fortune trying all these different business opportunities out for yourself. I did and believe me 95% of them didn't work but now I'm making quite a bit using a number of different websites. \n\nOne of the ones I found worked best is Protry.com or DataEntryPros. \n\nBasically you sign up with them and then simply enter in lines of data they give you, send it back and they send you out a check! I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $200-$300. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra bit of cash aswell as my full time job (which I love!) so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \n\nYou do have to be prepare to spend a small amount of money but just do what I did..all of these sites offer a 30 day money back guarantee..use them for 30 days, make some cash then just cancel the \nsubscription...I know you won`t though! :o) \n\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \n\nHope this helps!\nGoodluck,\nMatthew"

8851,"allright, where to begin, wiretapping american citizens has been going on for as long as it has been technologically possible, every president that could use it did to some degree, Nixon made it his favorite pastime and Bush seems to be obsessed with it, any legal resrictions against wiretaps have never been a problem to get around. Interesting note, Rumsfeld and Cheney also served in the Nixon white house, the same two men serving in the two worst administrations yet, maybe Bush isn't the problem?,..also, you're wrong about only foriegners commiting terrorist acts(remember Oklahoma City, Columbine), truth is, almost all terrorist acts committed on American soil have been committed by American citizens. As an American citizen living on US soil, you are far, far, far, more likly to be killed by someone you know rather than a terrorist, your chances of being killed by a terrorist are about the same as your chances of winning the lottery and being struck by lighting on the same day, gang bangers and carjackers are a much bigger threat to your daily life...Did Bush know about 911 beforehand? Evidence says yes, but not in a malicious, premeditated, way, more like when ""you knew about the test last week but still didn't study"" kinda way, negligence mainly. My personal opinion of Bush is not favorable, he has no idea what life is like for the average American, he's never had to worry about paying the bills,losing a job,paying for health care, the price of gas, none of the things people have to deal with everyday, he has spent his entire life being George Bush Jr.,If he had been anyone else he would be stuck in some obscure mid level management job, he barely graduated high school or college, he barely passed the pilots exam, spent his so called military career being AWOL from the national guard.

8852,"You have mentioned some great artists... but in terms of a singer, songwriter, and producer, I think that Buddy Holly's death robbed music of such an incredible talent.

From a social stand point I believe that the drug related deaths of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin, were the end of the sixties... what ever peace, love, and hope there was in the 1960's died with them... and the government could point to these deaths to weaken the beliefs of the counter-culture. I do have to totally disagree with you though about Kurt Cobain... he had not even scratched the surface of his talent... He was surrounded by people who gave his art nothing... Nirvana would have broken up soon enough if he had stayed alive... Kurt had all of the talent... I think he would have evolved beyond the sonic noise of Nirvana and been some kind of a cross between Bob Dylan and Michael Stipe... we will never know. I have to think of John Bonham too... Led Zeppelin is still the God of Rock and the only reason they disbanded was because of his death... Zep would have weathered the storm of punk rock and who knows how much great rock they had in them... Robert Plant truly blossomed as a solo artist but as a group Zep is unrivaled."

8898,"The Ashes is a Test cricket series, played between England and Australia - it is international cricket's oldest and most celebrated rivalry dating back to 1882. It is currently played approximately biennially, alternately in England and Australia. The Ashes are ""held"" by the country which last won a series and to ""regain"" them the other country must win more Test matches in a series than the country that ""holds"" them. If a series is ""drawn"" then the country holding the Ashes retains them. The last Ashes series was played in England in 2005 when England regained The Ashes after a gap of 16 years by winning the series 2-1. The next Ashes series will be in Australia in 2006-07 and the next series in England will be in 2009.\n\nThe series is named after a satirical obituary published in The Sporting Times in 1882 following the match at The Oval, in which Australia beat England in England for the first time. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. The English media dubbed the next English tour, to Australia (1882-83) as the quest to regain The Ashes.\n\nA small terracotta urn was presented to the England captain Ivo Bligh by a group of Melbourne women at some point during the 1882-83 tour. The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of an item of cricket equipment, possibly a bail, ball or stump. The urn is not used as a trophy for the Ashes series, and whichever side ""holds"" the Ashes, the urn normally remains in the MCC Museum at Lord's because of its age and fragility] Since the 1998-99 Ashes series, a Waterford crystal trophy has been presented to the winners.\n\nIf you want to know more about Ashes Series, please check the following website:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes"

8907,"Target Corporation is the fourth largest retailer in the United States, operating 1,556 stores in 47 states. Formerly Dayton Hudson Corporation, Target has three main retail divisions: Target Stores, Mervyn's, and Marshall Field's. Target Stores is the number two discount retailer in the country, trailing only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and has distinguished itself from its competitors by offering upscale, fashion-conscious products at affordable prices. The 1,225 Target stores, which are located in 47 states, generated 84 percent of Target's fiscal 2002 revenues. Included in this store count are Target Greatland units, which are much larger than the typical Target store, averaging 145,000 square feet versus 126,000 square feet; as well as SuperTarget outlets, which are combined discount/grocery stores, averaging 175,000 square feet. Generating 9 percent of 2002 revenues were Mervyn's 267 stores situated in 14 states, primarily in the West, Southwest, and Midwest (specifically Minnesota and Michigan). Based in the San Francisco Bay area, Mervyn's positions itself as a chain of moderately priced, family friendly, neighborhood department stores. Target Corporation's full-service department store division, contributor of 6 percent of sales, is now consolidated under the Marshall Field's banner. The 62 Marshall Field's stores (which include locations that formerly operated under the Dayton's and J.L. Hudson's names) are located in eight states in the upper Midwest, with the majority found within three metropolitan areas: Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit. Target Corporation's philanthropy has been and still is legendary. In 1989 the corporation received the America's Corporate Conscience Award for its magnanimity, and Target contributes more than $2 million each week to the communities in which its stores are located.\n\nEarly Years\n----------------------------\nTarget Corporation bears the strong imprint of its founder, George Draper Dayton. Dayton's father, a physician in New York state, could not afford to send him to college, in part because the doctor freely gave his services to the poor. Hence Dayton set off on his own in 1873 at age 16 to work in a coal and lumberyard. A workaholic, he undermined his health and a year later had to return to the family home to recuperate. Undeterred, he went on to become a banker. Less than ten years later, in 1883, he was rich enough to buy the Bank of Worthington in Minnesota. Meanwhile he had married and had become active in the Presbyterian Church.\n\nDayton's connection with the Presbyterian Church proved to be instrumental to the rise of his Dayton Company. In 1893, the year of a recession that sent local real estate prices tumbling, the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis burned down. The insurance did not cover the cost of a new building, and the only other source of income, a corner lot next to the demolished church, was unsalable because the real estate market was doing poorly. The congregation prevailed on the Dayton family, who were faithful members of the church, to purchase it so the building of a new church could proceed. Dayton bought it and eventually erected a six-story building on the lot. Casting about for tenants, he decided to buy the nearby Goodfellow Dry Goods store and set it up in the new building. In the spring of 1902 the store was known as the Goodfellow Dry Goods store; in 1903 the corporate name was changed to Dayton Dry Goods Company, then seven years later simply Dayton Company, the forerunner of Dayton Hudson Corporation and, ultimately, Target Corporation.\n\nEventually the store would expand to fill the six-story edifice. Dayton, with no previous experience in the retail trade, wielded tight control of the company until his death in 1938. His principles of thrift and sobriety and his connections as a banker enabled the company to grow. As long as he was at the helm, the store was run as a fami"

8911,"use lock folder software .download it frm http://www.newsoftwares.net/folderlock/\n\nFolder Lock is a fast file-security program that can password-protect, lock, hide and encrypt any number of files, folders, drives, pictures and documents in seconds. Protected files are hidden, undeletable, inaccessible and highly secure. It hides files from kids, friends and co-workers, safeguards them from viruses, trojans, worms and spyware, and even protects them from networked PCs, cable users and hackers. Files can also be protected on USB Flash Drives, Memory Sticks, CD-RW, floppies and notebooks. Protection works even if files are taken from one PC to another on a removable disk, without the need to install any software. It locks files in Windows, DOS and even Safe Modes. Additional Options include Stealth Mode, Hacker Attempt Monitoring, Shred files, AutoLock, Auto Shutdown PC, Lock your PC, Erase PC tracks, 256-bit Blowfish Encryption and Context Menu in Explorer. Works on Windows 2003/XP/2000/NT/Me/98 and all kinds of disk types like FAT16, FAT32, NTFS. Folder Lock is the most downloaded file-security program in the market today."

If he does neither then the bill becomes a law by default.  However, if Congress adjourns before those 10 days are up, then the President can do neither and the bill will not become law.  The rationale is that the legislature has to be in session to affirm that a bill would become a law without the President's signature if he did nothing; if they're not in session, then a bill that the President has not acted on cannot become law."

At the time, I didn't want to make her mad- and my father was really abusive and would have hurt either me or one of my sisters who still lived at home.\nI announced I had to go home for the Summer. I wrote it in a letter because I couldn't bear to tell him. We were and are really inseperable. \nI went into the bathroom and burst into tears, as he read the letter. When I came back into the bedroom, he was sobbing on the bed and had put on a song he said reminded him of me. It was landslide by the Dixie Chicks. The lines 'I'm afarid of change because I've built my life around you', really moved me and he was inconsolable. \nI managed five days back in my home town before I realised I could have a new life away from the abuse and emotional blackmail. I think that song tripped a switch in my brain that told me to go back to the man I love.\nI can't listen to that song now, it reminds me of our struggle to be together and how we had to build everything from scratch- how when I returned to him I did not bring anything because if I took a suitcase my parents would surely have realised what I was doing and made it so I couldn't go anywhere.

I fear you would be disappointed with swedish attitudes to marriage etc, however, most people here simply don't bother getting married, and are perfectly happy that way (I recall one wee girl at preschool being surprised to find out you _could_ get married before you have children). That doesn't mean families aren't important, they are, very much so, but I rather the Swedish idea of what a family is tends not to revolve around a religious (or even civil) ceremony.\n\nYes there are people who work 40 hour weeks and have trouble making ends meet, but that's true anywhere.

But I think that even if people were all independent, that would not change how people feel about the two extreme worldviews of liberals/conservatives and this splits the parties more than anything.  The way that liberals in this country have gotten portrayed by conservatives (who support big business and are against most if not all social programs, except the ones for the war machine and business), is so distorted I don't even recognize them.  I've never in my 65 yrs. met a liberal like the misguided, simple-minded ones they discribe.  But I have met plenty of conservative, esp. Repubs (but Dems too) who are almost living stereotypes of a simple-minded, rigid anti-people (unless you're rich or aspiring ) conservatives.\n\nI think the way you're thinking is like being in a fantasy world.  It's a nice idea but people who are independents generally aren't in the fray.  I don't believe their voice is heard so they have little to no effect.  Females especially have been socialized to be peacemakers and I think more men should be and more women shouldn't be afraid to stand up and fight for things they care about.   Women's issues, peace, helping people who are disabled, poor, elderly instead of helping the rich get richer which has been happening in a terrible degree are moral values that I think are worth fighting for.\nSwitzerland was neutral in WWII and that was, almost everyone agrees, worth fighting in.  Being independent is like that.  I like what Mark Twain said.  He said he believed in the two-party system, that's why he was a Democrat, implying that at least two parties existed WITHIN the party.  If you study the parties, there ARE big differences in them and I think the DEMOCRATIC PARTY in spite of its craziness is a better representative of the best of AMERICA."

8978,"In Florida, you really do not need an attorney.\n\nMost of the contracts are form contracts that are filled out by realtors then the closing is handled by the title company.  Use the FARBAR contract... it's very straight forward.  Additionally, just keep your eyes open for any addendums or additions.\n\nWith title companies handling the closings, there really isn't as much of a need for real estate attorneys.\n\nReal estate attorneys would be able to handle more sophisticated real estate issues and negotiations.  For the most part, sales are very basic.  I believe that the real estate market is better off in general without requiring attorneys for a real estate transaction.\n\nI did my fair share of sales in NYC(in which attorneys are required to create contracts and close sales), and for the most part on complicated transactions real estate attorneys are good to have.  When the attorney involved was just an 'attorney' they usually created awful messes.  Some of which cost my clients hundreds of thousands of dollars because of their incompetence with real estate law.\n\nTransactions here in FL overall are smoother without need for attorneys.  And since you are permitted by law to have direct contact with the title company and other participants in the transaction 99% of the attorney's job you can do yourself.  Basically, making sure that everyone else is doing their thing.\n\nThe last 1% that a real estate attorney might be helpful with is for document reveiw.  If you are unable to 'cough' read or unable to sign the documents yourself... then they can be useful for FL transactions.\n\nAgain, I say this because the paperwork is standardized in a very high percentage of the transactions.

8989,"This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\n\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?"

Its hard to streamline so many interests.\n\nPart of the problem is that hard core elements dominate either party, which make them less appealing to ""moderates."" This is reflected in the mistaken rhetoric that one is either a conservative or a liberal. I have views that some consider ""liberal,"" but support the death penalty and own several firearms, for instance. \n\nIn the last election, the Democrats ran a Liberal senator from a Liberal state against a moron with whom enough red-necks and Bible thumpers connected to eke out a win. Bush could have been defeated. All the Dems needed was a candidate who actually came out and stood for something. I wanted to like Kerry, but he lacked charisma and he seemed to say whatever he thought was politically advantageous. Unfortunately, the neo-fascists, um, neo-cons, were able to seize on that indecisiveness as what the country doesn't need in a time of ""war"" (of Bushie's own making). Result: the guy who actually fought in a war was deemed a weakling/coward/liar; while the coke-snorting deserter was ""The War President"" (again, in a war of his own making). That the Democratic Party has allowed itself to be portrayed as God-less and soft on ""terrorism"" and national defense is a flat-out disgrace. They deserved to lose because they lacked the guts to run a candidate with strong convictions and a voting record to back them.\n\nRight now, Obama looks like a candidate who could appeal to a broad spectrum of our increasingly diverse population. But, unless the DemoCommunist extremists drop their efforts to disarm the populace (and thereby rendering us defenseless against enemies from within and without), and to make us a socialist nation by lavishing benefits upon everyone it'll be hard to vote for one."

9074,"To understand the answer better, I have prepared a small course on CD's for you. \n\n--How the CD is constructed--\nA CD is a fairly simple piece of plastic, about four one-hundredths (4/100) of an inch (1.2 mm) thick. Most of a CD consists of an injection-molded piece of clear polycarbonate plastic. \n\nDuring manufacturing, this plastic is impressed with microscopic bumps arranged as a single, continuous, extremely long spiral track of data. Once the clear piece of polycarbonate is formed, a thin, reflective aluminum layer is sputtered onto the disc, covering the bumps. Then a thin acrylic layer is sprayed over the aluminum to protect it.\n\n--The spiral on a CD--\nA CD has a single spiral track where data is burned on, circling from the inside of the disc to the outside. It is extremely small - approximately 0.5 microns wide, with 1.6 microns separating one track from the next. (A micron is a millionth of a meter.)\n\n--How things are written onto a CD--\nInformation are burned into the plastic of a CD in the form of small pits, or bumps. The bumps that make up the round track are each 0.5 microns wide, a minimum of 0.83 microns long and 125 nanometers high. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.)\n\nThe incredibly small dimensions of the bumps make the spiral track on a CD extremely long. If you could lift the data track off a CD and stretch it out into a straight line, it would be 0.5 microns wide and almost 3.5 miles (5 km) long! \n\nA CD drive has a laser beam which shines onto the track of the CD and picks up the bumps. The bumps are converted to information that the computer or CD player understands.\n\nIf you want more detailed information, visit http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cd.htm\n\nHope I could help..."

I believe it was dated to B.C. ...I just found this.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAncient artifacts discovered imbedded in solid rock, as well as artifacts found on the ocean floor, give evidence to the fact that our ancient ancestors were FAR more intelligent in the scientific realm than we give them credit for. Yves Naud describes in his book, one such artifact: ""In 1900, sponge divers near Antikythera (Greece), found rusty fragments of a metallic apparatus on the sea floor. Scientists at first thought that they were remnants of an astrolabe dating from 65 B.C. In 1959, the English scientist, Solla Price, made a discovery which astounded the professional world when he published it in the NATURAL HISTORY review of March 1962: \n\n""'It appears that this object is really a computer which can determine and describe the movements of the sun, of the moon, and probably of the planets.' \n\n""This modern expert felt extremely humble and could only pay homage to the high science of our ancestors, although the homage was tinged with fear. \n\n""'It is quite frightening,' he wrote in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (June, 1959), 'to learn that, shortly before their great civilization crumbled, THE ANCIENT GREEKS had come as close as this to our time, not only in terms of their thinking, but also in their scientific technology.'"""

AT THE VERY TOP YOU WILL SEE A LINK THAT SAYS ""STANDARD VIEW"" CLICK ON IT TO GET TO THE WORKING PART OF GMAIL.\n\nOne of the best features is how easy it is to keep up with a conversation with a single friend. All of your previous posts to that\nperson are right there for you to review in case you forgot what you were talking about. Another good feature is that everyone that emails you is automatically added into your contacts list (address book). Currently there is no way to opt out of that.

This is why you had to be invited to use it instead of just signing up for it like you would normally do with everything else. Because it is still being tested it will occasionally not do what you want it to do. When this happens keep trying until it gives up and report it to one of the following GMail Help groups below.\n\nUsually after a week or two you will be given the ability to invite others to Gmail.

9158,"Softball like baseball is played by men and women. There are two types of softball, fast pitch and slow pitch. Four main differences between soft ball and baseball are that the ball is larger in the game of softball,the ball is pitched underhand, the bases are situated closer together and the pitching mound is considerably closer to the batter.\n\nWhile slow pitch softball is more a leisurely recreational game with much activity because the ball is pitched slow with a required arc  and scoring is usually frequent, fast pitch softball is more a pitcher oriented low scoring game. Even the best of batters in fastball have difficulty hitting. Batting against top notch pitchers in fast pitch soft ball is not for the faint of heart. The ball comes from the mound which is only 40-46 feet away, and at speeds upwards of 80 mph. Soft ball games are usually only 7 innings long and in top competitive games it is not unusual for pitchers to attain 12 -15 strikeouts. \nBelieve me, some of the best MLB players would have difficulty looking good at the plate in elite player fastball (softball) games, whether it is a man or a woman pitching."

9182,"People tend to have more credit today and to shop for credit - via the internet and other channels-more frequently than ever.  FICO scores reflect this reality.  However, research shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period of time does represent greater risk - especially for people who do not have a long established credit history.\n\nMultiple credit requests also represent greater credit risk.  However, FICO scores do a good job of distinguishing between a search for many new credit accounts and rate shopping for one new account.  Your FICO score takes into account:\n\n1) How many new accounts you have.  Your FICO score looks at how many new accounts you have by type of account (for example, how many newly opened credit cards you have).  It also may look at how many of your accounts are new accounts.\n2) How long it has been since you opened a new account.  Your FICO score may consider this information for specific types of accounts.\n3) How many recent requests for credit you have made, as indicated by inquiries to the credit reporting agencies.  Inquiries remain on your credit report for two years, although FICO scores only consider inquiries from the last 12 months.  FICO scores have been carefully designed to count only those inquiries that truly impact credit risk.\n4) Length of time since credit report inquiries were made by lenders.\n\nSo in summary, if it's been some time since your last new line of credit was opened, or you last applied for a dept store card, opening and promptly closing a new account will more than likely not dramatically impact your score. On the other hand, if you plan on doing this regularly, I would recommend just waiting for the store sales to get that extra 15% off. Good luck!"

9196,"I’m not too sure where all this meaning comes as in “to share” or “go for it”. During my child-hood years. The actaul word was “fuck eyed”‘; and it only ment one thing. Which was beaten up. As I recall in years between 1974 - 1982, whenever some kid came into school with the infamous “black eye”. Everyone would say out loud, “Check it out, he got fuck eyed from someone”. For the real locals it would be something more like this “Lana sa ma fuck-eye si dude”. My assupmptoin to where the spelling came from “FOKAI” is almost in the sense of how Germans would spell their own words. If you look at early on “FOKAI” logos/letterings there would be two dots above the letter O. There are other similiar logos / saying like “Farfrompuken”, the two dots would be above the letter U. This saying usually had a picture of a man running to the toilet bowl getting ready to barf all his alcohol that he drank. Another saying would be fukengroven, again the two dots above the letters U and O. In in a sense not to show bad slander in the eye of the public, the creator(and I’m guessing at this) decided to spell “fuck eye” as fokai."

9219,"The rest of the partition may be used by the swap file which is not reported in Explorer.  Try reducing your swap file size.\n\nAlso, depending upon the sizes of your files, they may be taking up more disk space than the actual totals of the files.  In short, the file system can only write in fixed-length blocks (I think NTFS default is 64K).  If a file does not occupy the entire block, the rest is not used...the next file must be written to another block.  If you have tons of small files on your hard drive you may be using much more than the total sizes of the files.  There's not much way around this other than moving the files to another partition with smaller block sizes.\n\nFinally, some applications (like Photoshop) actually reserve block of space on the hard drive as ""private"" swap space.  This guarantees the application will always have a work area on the disk while its operating.  Check with the software vendor for some of your applicationsto see if this is the case and if you can either resize the reserved block, or move it to another drive."

I don't know the answer to that.  We readily accept a women in pants, but we ridicule a man in a dress.  We encourage young girls to push the boundaries and not be defined by traditional female roles, yet we offer no similar encouragement to young boys.  Perhaps it is because women have long been regarded as second class citizens (even though they are not) and many see women adopting men's styles and roles as some sort of perverse evolution.  The same people would probably view a man wanting to adopt more feminine styles and roles as some sort of backslider.

Oh, you could drive your car on the highway as long as you were not going to the store, or to work at a private company (unless that company was a government, education, or non-profit contractor), or to purchase or provide a service.\n\nBefore Boucher's legislation passed there was no such thing as Amazon.com, eBay, Google, PayPal, or, for that matter, YAHOO. There was no legal way for these business to exist at all. It was actually ILLEGAL to conduct any for-profit activities on the Internet, including (but not limited to):\n  - buying\n  - selling\n  - advertizing\n  - banking\n  - product support\nIt was of course an unenforceable system.

9281,"Coors Field, located in Denver, Colorado is the home field of the National League's Colorado Rockies. It is named for the Coors Brewing Company of Golden, Colorado, which purchased the naming rights to the park prior to its completion in 1995. The Rockies played their first two seasons, 1993 and 1994, in Mile High Stadium before moving to Coors Field, two blocks from Union Station in Denver's Lower Downtown (or LoDo) neighborhood. The park includes 63 luxury suites and 4,500 club seats.\n\nCoors Field has a reputation as a home run-friendly park that, arguably, equals Chicago's venerable Wrigley Field. Though the fences are actually more distant than in most other facilities, the high altitude of the city (which is indeed about one mile above sea level), decreases air resistance on batted balls. Perhaps even more significantly, the low air pressure also causes pitches to break less severely and hence be easier to hit. Other factors include the relatively low height of the fences and very limited foul territory area.\n\nDue to Coors Field's location on Blake Street and its propensity for giving up home runs, Rockies players are informally called the ""Blake Street Bombers.""\n\nCoors Field was originally planned to be somewhat smaller, seating only 43,800. However, after the Rockies' first season, plans were altered during construction, and new seats, mostly in the center field bleacher section, were added.

Here read...\n\n-------------------------\n\nFilipinos.....*make me puke* (Art Bell)\n\nAs we've all come to notice, in the past few decades, Filipinos have begun to infest the United States like some sort of disease. Their extensive involvement in the U.S. Armed Forces is proof of the trashy kind of qualities all filipinos tend to exhibit on a regular basis. You can see this clearly by studying the attitudes and cultural Icons of most Filipino Americans.\n\nOrigins of Pinoys/Pinays: \n\nAre they really asian? Well we've come to accept the fact the filipinos come from a part of the world known as South East Asia. But the term ""Asia"" is used in the wrong way. You may notice that contemporary Filipino Americans try very hard to associate themselves with groups that we know as Asian. I cannot count the number of times I have seen a 'Third World' Filipino try to connect themselves to the chinese or Japanese people. There is no connection and here's why. The Philippines is a Third World country. Nothing respectable has EVER been created by Filipino people during our entire human history. Young filipino men in America have become obsessed with ""import racing"". They have an enormously perverted affection for Japanese cars. It's a common phenomenon. In their minds, these Filipinos somehow believe that they are asian and that it somehow connects them to Japanese people and japanese cars. They often take credit for the ingenuity of Japanese people and say how it's an ""Asian thing"". This term...""Asian thing"" derived directly from African American slang ""black thang"". ""It's a black thang."" ""It's an asian thang."" \n\nYou can see the connection. It's even funnier that, in Japan, Filipinos are heavily discriminated against. The only filipinos that can live successfully in Japan are the filipino prostitutes. But that's the case for most Filipino people no matter where they live in th e world. Now we've come down to this fact...and it is a fact. \n\nNothing in Filipino Culture can be seen as Asian.\n\nThey have no architectural, artistic, or cultural influence which is in ANY way, asian. Thinking of the great countries in Asia such as Japan, Korea, and China there is no way you can possibly connect the Philippine Islands. This assault by filipino americans to connect themselves with the great peoples of North East Asia is foul and disgusting. Try visiting a young filipino's web site too. \n\nYou'll see something called the ""Asian IRC Ring"". It has to do with the chatrooms. The most horrible thing about this is that these TRASHY people are trying to associate themselves with Asia again!! People in Asia don't act like this at all. What we are seeing here is the natural Filipino in its element with full access to technology and this is how they act! You will consistently see this behavior over and over again. \n\nAnother interest ing thing is that these ""thirdworld"" people also frequent RC chatrooms such as #chinese #japan and #asian. They must believe that they are somehow related racially or culturally to North Asians. But it's completely WRONG! There might have been some distant contact With China and even less with Japan during World War II, but these people are actually more closely related to african americans and Mexican americans. \n\nDo the parents of these young filipinos know what's going on? Would they accept this? I believe that they would and do. This is the natural ""Trash"" element in filipinos manifesting itself. Nothing good has ever come from Philippines and I don't believe anything good ever will. \n\nRecognizing your Roots (A Message to Filipinos). To all filipino people: \nPleas"

The investor that make the morgage determines the penalty.\n\nWhy do you have a pre-payment penalty on your mortgage? Normally prepayments are for 2 or 3 years and prehaps 5 years in some instances.\n\nBefore the loan closes some lenders offer to allow you to buy the prepay out or take a yearor two off it.\n\nNow let's answer your question, most lenders have no way of you getting out of the prepay,because you signed a contract with this in the contract.\n\nOne way to get out of most prepays is to sell the property the prepay is waived if you have what is normally called a soft prepay. \n\nIf you refinance you are accessed a hard prepay and you must come to grips with the fact that this must and will be paid.  There is no hardship waiver in any mortgage contract that I know of.\n\nYour best bet if here is any action to be taken on your behalf is to call you lender and see if there is anything they can do.

9385,"Market capitalization, often abbreviated to market cap, is a business term that refers to the aggregate value of a firm's outstanding common shares. In essence, market capitalization reflects the total value of a firm's equity currently available on the market. This measure differs from equity value to the extent that a firm has outstanding stock options or other securities convertible to common shares. The size and growth of a firm's market capitalization is often one of the critical measurements of a public company's success or failure. However, market capitalization may increase or decrease for reasons unrelated to performance such as acquisitions, divestitures and stock repurchases.\n\nMarket capitalization is the number of common shares multiplied by the current price of those shares. The term capitalization is sometimes used as a synonym of market capitalization; more often, it denotes the total amount of funds used to finance a firm's balance sheet and is calculated as market capitalization plus debt (book or market value) plus preferred stock.\n\nThe total  market capitalization of all the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange is greater than the amount of money in the United States [1]. The global market capitalization for all stock markets was $43.6 trillion in March 2006 [2"

He had litte doubt that the allies would win the war. Therefore, he focused most of his efforts with secret diplomacy with Stalin, the best known being the ""blue pencil"" agreement.

9500,"You probably need to think first about what PART of advertising you want to go into.  There are two main sides to any advertising agency.  The ""account side"" and the ""creative side"".  The account side is sales people, account managers, relationship managers, etc.  The creative side is designers, writers, editors, creative directors, all the typical video / film type people (directors, sound techs, etc), and those sorts.  Agencies also have the corporate business functions like accounting and HR, but that probably isn't what you're looking for.\n\nIf your interest is on the creative side, you probably want to look for specialty programs for the area you're looking for.  Develop your ""art"" at the same time you develop your knowledge of advertising.\n\nIf your interest is on the account side, then you want to probably look for a school with a program that will give you good advertising theory, but you'll also want to make sure you're getting steeped in ""business"" in general.  You need to know some about project management, accounting, finance, marketing, etc. - all the things ""business people"" are concerned with because those are the people you work with.\n\nIf you are interested in advertising, I would also suggest that you look into the different fields of ""marketing.""  It sounds like you're in high school so those two words may sound like they mean the same thing, but marketing is much more broad than advertising.  Marketers concern themselves with all decisions pertaining to the ""four P's"" - Product, Price, Place and Promotion.  Advertising falls into the promotion P but marketing people also deal with pricing studies, product attributes and development, portfolio mixes, marketing research, etc.  A marketing person is the one who might decide, for instance, that in order to maximize profits for a brand, the price needs to be higher.  But in order to increase the price, the image may need to be brougt more upscale than it currently is.  So they'll work with the packaging people to make nicer packaging, they may work with product development to add features or other value, and they'll tell the advertising agency what the objective is for the advertising needed.  The agency then goes and develops ads that, hopefully, will do what is needed.\n\nMarketing and advertising are far more complex than they seem at first because at the end of the day, there is big money and serious business involved.  But they're exhilerating, exciting fields also.\n\nBTW, there is very little advertising happening in Vermont.  Some, but not much.  If you're looking to build a big career in advertising, you're most likely going to need to do it in a large city, and if your career clicks and you really start moving and shaking, you'll have to be in a major market like New York or Chicago.\n\nGood luck!"

Originally based in Orlando, Florida, they are now based in Kissimmee, Florida, a suburb south of Orlando in Osceola County. The ownership group of the Seals is led by David Waronker.\n\nThe team was formed as the Orlando Seals, and played its first season beginning in October 2002 with the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL). It was the winner of that league's first and only President's Cup in 2003. When the ACHL folded, they and two other teams, the Jacksonville Barracudas and the Macon Trax, merged into the new World Hockey Association 2 (WHA2), founded by Waronker himself. After the 2003-2004 season, the World Hockey Association served a cease-and-desist order on the WHA2 and it merged with the South East Hockey League (SEHL) to form the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL).\n\nThe Orlando Seals were scheduled to play in the 2004-2005 SPHL season, but on August 22, 2004, the City of Orlando revoked its lease at the TD Waterhouse Centre, causing them to miss the season. On October 19, 2004, the ownership group announced a new three-year lease with the Silver Spurs Arena in Kissimmee. The team resumed play in the 2005-2006 season, hosting their first home game against the Jacksonville Barracudas on October 29, 2005.\n\nThe mascot of the Florida Seals is Sealvester.

9644,I wouldn't say I was disappointed.  I liked the movie and the story itself.  It didn't make me uncomfortable in any way but that's because I'm actually open minded about this sort of thing and I think everybody should be allowed to love anybody they like whether they're opposite sex or the same sex.  I thought the acting was really good in the movie but the story was slow at times and dragged on. I think Jake Gyllenhaal's character was more 'in love' than Heath Ledger's character.  But there were a few times where I felt really sad for them 'cause they couldn't be together - like that one scene at the lake where Jake's character is really upset they can't see each other.  I'm glad the movie was made.  It definitely shows Hollywood is a bit more open minded these days.  I mean when you think of some foreign movies this subject is not that controversial but for Hollywood it obviously is.  I mean the supposed 'sex scene' wasn't all that bad - at least not as bad as everybody made it seem.  I'm not homophobic so for me it was fine to watch.  And it'll open doors for other small movies with interesting subject matters unlike the same old same old lame Hollywood bullcrap.

Is the ladder in good order, does it have a hand rail.

Unit trusts should be viewed as a medium to long term investment (5 years minimum, preferrably more) so don't put in all your money, or any that you will be needing in a short time.

9674,"Here is some information about what courses to take for the bar exam - I highly recommend all courses though because you will be tested on them. Also every state has different set of laws that you will be studying and you may be tested on those areas so it is good to have those courses out of the way as well. \n\nThe first component, the Multistate Bar Exam, is the same in every state. It consists of 200 multiple-choice questions prepared by the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) covering a range of legal topics, including contracts, constitutional law, criminal law and procedure, evidence, property and torts. You will have six hours to answer these questions, in two periods of three hours each. This gives you a little less than two minutes per question. The MBE questions are not short. A question might be several sentences long and each answer will probably also be a sentence or two. In other words, you'll probably need the whole six hours to complete the exam. The District of Columbia and all states except Louisiana and Washington require lawyers to have passed the MBE. \n\nVirtually every state bar exam includes a second, and sometimes even a third, day of essays. Some exams tailor questions to their state's laws (for example, California, New York, Maryland, North Carolina), while other states use the Multistate Essay Exam as their essay section. The Multistate Essay Exam consists of six essay questions spread over the course of three hours. Other states have their own format. Some topics might be familiar to you from your law school classes (like contracts, real property and torts), but others will only ring a bell if you took the course as an elective (such as wills, family law, conflict of laws or corporations). There will be as many as 20 different areas of law that you need to study. \n\nAnother component common to most bar exams is known as the Multistate Performance Test. This section is designed to test your lawyering abilities and responses to ethical dilemmas and clients. Not all states use this in their bar exams, and some only use part of it (New York, for example, has only one Multistate Performance question, while other states include more). This section is generally only allotted an hour or two. \n\nFinally, before you graduate from law school, you will probably be required to take an ethics test, known as the Multistate Professional Responsibility Test. The MPRE is a little over two hours long and consists of 50 multiple-choice questions designed to measure your knowledge of ethical standards of the legal profession. The exam is offered by the NCBE three times a year, in March, August and November. If you are not required by your state to take the MPRE, you might be subject to a separate ethics section when you take your bar exam. \n\nI hope this helps!"

9676,"I'd like to ask you something. Why did you call yourself [swear word] stupid, mentally deranged and retarded? You made four mistakes in your three sentences!\n\n1) You put a comma before ""and"" in the actual question. You only use a comma before a conjunction (and, but, or, nor) when it is a compound sentence. You question is not a compound sentence because you could not say ""Why are people on the internet so [swear word] stupid? Unable to use proper grammar? It doesn't work. To use a comma before and, you must say ""Why are people so [swear word] stupid, and why are they unable to use proper grammar.\n\n2) You made a second mistake in your details. You did not put a comma after ""Seriously."" You need a comma there because it is a parenthetical expression. Basically, you could say ""Are you all mentally degranged [mispelled as it was in question] or something makes no change to the meaning of the sentence.\n\n3) Finally, you misspelled ""deranged"" (Yes, spelling is part of grammar!). You spelled it degranged, which is not a word in the English language. Even if it were correct in a foreign language, it would still be improper grammar because you cannot mix two languages in one sentence unless it is for demonstrative purposes.\n\n4) You were redundant with the use of mentally and deranged. There is only one way to be deranged, and that is mentally. You should have just said ""deranged""!\n\nIn response to your question, people are apparently unable to use grammar because they do exactly the same thing you do. They don't memorize their grammar rules, don't spell check, and don't care! They are too lazy! You can't criticise, because you do it yourself.\n\nNOTE: I have read this three (3) times, and it looks like good grammar to me. Even if I made a mistake, at least I tried to proof-read it!\n\nNOTE: If a sentence/word in quotes is misspelled/has bad grammar, it is because I was mimicking the way you spelled it in your question. I removed swear words and replaced them with [swear word].\n\nNOTE: Three-quarters of the people who answered your question have bad grammar! It illustrates my point perfectly!"

9767,"The risk of injury from hockey is pretty much the same as you face with any other sport.  The most serious possibilities are head and neck injuries and work their way down to the less serious things such as bumps and bruises.  USA Hockey, the governing body of ice hockey in the USA from the Olympic team down to the little guys, has done a pretty good job of educating players, coaches and officials of the risks and how to prevent them.  They have also made a priority of enacting rules to prevent the infractions that cause the most serious injuries such as checking from behind.  I have played for 35 years and have had my share of stitches but thus far (knock wood!) nothing serious.\n\nThere have been some well publicized injuries such as Travis Roy who suffered a spinal cord injury in his first college game and Clint Malarchuk who had his jugular vein sliced in an NHL game.  These are extremely rare occurrances and given the quality of hockey equipment these days, the risks involved are no greater than or even less than any other sport.  I do not have the numbers in front of me, but I have read that there are more injuries annually from both soccer and football.\n\nThere is one health issue that has popped up recently in hockey although more-so in other sports where players share a locker room and showers, flesh-eating bacteria.  It is much more prevalent in wrestling with the close contact and minimal clothes and equipment but there have been recent cases reported from hockey locker rooms as well.\n\nFrom a general health standpoint, visit your doctor and have a physical.  If you are in reasonably good health there is no reason you cannot play hockey.  It's a great game and there are levels of hockey out there for everyone these days."

When the F is double sharped, you start from F natural and go up two to G natural.  \n\nIn measure 34, the first F double sharp means that all F's (on that line) will be double sharped.  But the third F is one octave above the first F, so it has to have a double sharp as well.  Double sharps carry through the measure, but only at their pitch.  So if you have a note that is the same tone but different pitch, then it has to be double-sharped again.\n\nSo if your F one octave middle C is double sharped, then all F's one octave above middle C in that measure are double sharped and don't need the sign in front of it.  But if you have an F two octaves above middle C, then that has to be sharped.\n\nHey, if worst comes to worst, just listen to the CD and play by ear.  If it sounds weird, then try something else...good luck!"

If it doesn't work you can just go back to restore, and click undo last restore point. Other than that... make sure you got no viruses, and download spybot search and destroy. Make sure it's cleaned out. Defrag, disk cleanup, virus check, spyware/adware check. If all else fails, when you buy the new drive, format and re-install windows.

9861,"The regional progressive primary is definitely a better idea than ONE national primary.  The purely national approach would make it impossible for anyone to compete but those who could spend the big bucks immediately in the major population centers (big states like California, New York), and would very much cut against the historic concern --still seen in the much misunderstood and unfarily maligned Electoral College-- of allowing various states and regions to have a say in the selection of the President, not just big population centers.\n\nAnother note -- the criticism of our 'founding fathers' for the part and primary system is rather offbase.  The Constitution had NOTHING about parties, and most of our leaders initially railed AGAINST the formation of specific parties... but it still happened in the 1790s, and proved a more constuctive way to resolve issues than the focus on personalities that happened when there was not a functioning two-pary system (which could get quite personal and bitter, as both John Adams and his son found out).  \n\nAs for the whole primary system, that is later still, after the convention system was in place.

Snooker is particularly popular in English-speaking countries (Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia and South Africa), and there has recently been a surge of interest in East Asia, with players from Hong Kong, China and Thailand entering the rankings.

9914,"Do you have any sort of chronic illness or condition that requires ongoing medical treatment? If you do, then the insurance you have with your company might be the least expensive that you’ll find. I would say go with less insurance coverage if you were comfortable with that, except for your age – you’re not 16 any more (and I haven’t been in a while, either, thank God). You don’t qualify for Medicare because you have to be 65 or have serious kidney problems. You’re best bet in finding out whether there is an affordable private insurance out there is to talk with local state-licensed health insurance agents. Below, I’ve included a link to a site that can help you do that. However, keep in mind that moving from a group health plan to an individual health plan negates the time you were insured at work. What I meant is that, if you have group health insurance (through work), and were to get another job, the new job would have to give you health insurance (as long as they offer it to their employees). You’re not protected in that way if you go to an individual plan. That’s why if you have a pre-existing condition, you might want to make sure the people at work won’t do something for you.\n\nHere are some quick thoughts. All the Web sites I mention are listed below.\n1.Welfare: It’s not insurance, exactly, but if you need help, you need help. The money you could save through the program could be used to help get insurance or afford your insurance at work.\n2.Medicaid: Link below to get in touch with your state’s Medicaid office.\n3.State Insurance Office (link below). Ask them about programs to assist people who are in your situation.\n4.Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS): It’s free and they can help you and your daughter build up your credit and help with financial planning. They can also negotiate credit card debt to lower payments and interest rates. Make sure that if you go to a consumer credit counseling service they are part of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.\n5.Benefits Check Up (link below): Find out what government-sponsored program you’re eligible for. It’s not just for health insurance, and it’s provided by the National Council on Aging.\n6.Needy Meds: If you have a specific illness, there might be an organization that can help pay for your treatment (link below).\n\nI’d try to find help first, but I’d also check around to see how expensive private insurance would be. Visit MostChoice.com. It’s a site that provides free quotes and plan details on health insurance, but it also lets local insurance agents know you’re looking for a new health plan. There’s no cost or obligation. You just tell the agents what kind of coverage you need and the money you can spend, and they do all the legwork. Even if you don’t find anything that’s right for you, it will give you a good idea of what’s out there without having to do all the work yourself.\n\nYou can find it here: http://www.mostchoice.com/health-insurance.cfm\n\nGood luck.\n\nBarnes@MostChoice"
9915,"Why are wars fought?  It is a philosophical question not a political question.  Think about it for a moment.  Why would anyone kill or risk being killed in massive numbers.  History is littered with dead soldiers and dead causes.  It defies all logic to run towards gunfire or to press forward after experiencing casualties.\n\nWars are started by politicians.  Wether it is a king, president, general, dictator, etc., it is a small group making the decision and thrusting others into the fray.

It was shed in Selma, it was shed in Money, it was shed in Jackson, it was shed in Philadelphia, it was shed in Memphis, it was shed in Birmingham, and a whole bunch of cities and towns no one talks about and many can't remember.

There are many businesses that you can start with $25,000. \n\nThe key is to determine what your interests are, what you want to do, what is suitable for your lifestyle and your overall goals, and what can fit with your resources.\n\nDan Ramsey in his book ""101 Best Home Businesses"" has a chapter on how to find YOUR best home business. He suggests these 10 steps:\n\n1. List 5 things you do best\n2. List how others would benefit from what you do best\n3. Find out how to give people what they want\n4. Learn the value of your services to others\n5. Find out who else offers similar services\n6. Learn from the successes of others\n7. Learn from the failures of others\n8. Plan your own success\n9.

Find a business that you can start for little money (e.g. an errand business where your main cost is telephone and gasoline is easier to start than starting a Subway franchise) Entrepreneur Magazine has a good list of Low Cost Startup Businesses that you may want to consider  http://www.entrepreneur.com/lowcostbusinesses/0,6617,,00.html\nSome other home business ideas:\n\nTop 10 Home Businesses with Rapid Break-Even Time http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol33/breakeven.htm\n10 Profitable “Go-Out"" Home Businesses http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol31/goout.htm\n6 Hottest Businesses on the Web  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/web.htm \n\n2. Consider your time and effort - if you have little cash, you may have to work harder for the money because you will have no resource to outsource or employ others to do certain tasks for you; or you have no money to buy equipment so you can only do certain things the long way\n\n3. Get your creative juices flowing. With no money, the only thing you have is your imagination. Be creative and find ways to get things done \n\n4. Be prepared to do all the work yourself - from doing your business plan, finding financing, writing emails, shipping and handling, marketing or whatever processes your business requires. \n\n5. Be prepared to invite investors - you may need financing help from someone down the road so be prepared to share some of the pie."

Pickups are nice, but none of this even matters if your using cheap cables, and a cheap amp too. Everything has to be good quality or theres really no point in adding to your guitar.I mean if you get let say a pair of emgs put in, they would normally be great mid-high range guitar tones, but if your amp doesnt have good distortion and sounds grainy, well your upgrade is only doing half of what it should.The cheapest thing on my list is cables-bad cables suck tone.You could also get a nice lil graphic eq, they can help a lot for a lil money."

10033,"Most of the times we laugh at ""that"" funny thing,by thinking,\n""Thank God! That didn't happend with me....""\n\nWHY DO WE LAUGH?\nLaughter is part of the universal human vocabulary. All members of the human species understand it. Unlike English or French or Swahili, we don’t have to learn to speak it. We’re born with the capacity to laugh.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about laughter is that it occurs unconsciously. You don’t decide to do it. While we can consciously inhibit it, we don’t consciously produce laughter. That’s why it’s very hard to laugh on command or to fake laughter. (Don’t take my word for it: Ask a friend to laugh on the spot.)\n\nLaughter provides powerful, uncensored insights into our unconscious. It simply bubbles up from within us in certain situations.\n\nVery little is known about the specific brain mechanisms responsible for laughter. But we do know that laughter is triggered by many sensations and thoughts, and that it activates many parts of the body. \n\nWhen we laugh, we alter our facial expressions and make sounds. During exuberant laughter, the muscles of the arms, legs and trunk are involved. Laughter also requires modification in our pattern of breathing.\n\nWe also know that laughter is a message that we send to other people. We know this because we rarely laugh when we are alone (we laugh to ourselves even less than we talk to ourselves).\n\nLaughter is social and contagious. We laugh at the sound of laughter itself. That’s why the Tickle Me Elmo doll is such a success — it makes us laugh and smile.\n\nThe first laughter appears at about 3.5 to 4 months of age, long before we’re able to speak. Laughter, like crying, is a way for a preverbal infant to interact with the mother and other caregivers.\n\nContrary to folk wisdom, most laughter is not about humor; it is about relationships between people. To find out when and why people laugh, I and several undergraduate research assistants went to local malls and city sidewalks and recorded what happened just before people laughed. Over a 10-year period, we studied over 2,000 cases of naturally occurring laughter.\n\nWe found that most laughter does not follow jokes. People laugh after a variety of statements such as “Hey John, where ya been?” “Here comes Mary,” “How did you do on the test?” and “Do you have a rubber band?”. These certainly aren’t jokes.\n\nWe don’t decide to laugh at these moments. Our brain makes the decision for us. These curious “ha ha ha’s” are bits of social glue that bond relationships.\n\nCuriously, laughter seldom interrupts the sentence structure of speech. It punctuates speech. We only laugh during pauses when we would cough or breathe."

Although Guerrero had not taken alcohol or illicit drugs for over four years, his past excesses contributed to his heart failure. At the time of his death, he had recently used narcotic painkillers.\n\nGuerrero's wife Vickie said that he had been lethargic and unwell in the week preceding his death, but that this had been attributed to the stress of continuously traveling and performing. She added that the doctors had told her that Guerrero's blood vessels had shriveled and weakened owing to undiagnosed heart disease, and that he had simply dropped into a deep sleep.\n\nOn the November 30, 2005 edition of WWE Byte This!, Chavo Guerrero, Jr. said that Guerrero had been working very hard and was at peak physical fitness as a result, doing cardiovascular and weight training exercises every day. There had been no symptoms or cause for concern.

In other words, dual-channel vs. single-channel. That's it, from the processor's standpoint. As for the other candy (SLI, PCI-E, etc), those are generally to be found on S939 motherboards, simply because those are where the manufacturers make their money."

10155,"Dear Sir, this is a very deep question! There are so many ways in which you can prepare yourself - \n\n1. Finances - Make sure your finances are strong so that even after retirement you are able to maintain the same standard of living. Make sure you will be economically stable and independent even after retirement. This means - invest wisely!\n\n2. Emotionally - Here you won't have to do much; the moment you retire, it is like the final homecoming for you. From then on, you will become an indispensible part of the house just like the doors, windows and your wife have been all these years. Yes, you have been in the same family all these years, but from now on, you'll be more into the family than into anything else.\n\n3. Socially - Start gathering contacts of all your friends since childhood. Once you retire you will have lot of time, when you can visit them all and refresh friendships which will make you feel socially secure.\n\n4. Something for your wife - I would suggest that you start learning household chores! :D I know most Indian men hate to work at home. But think - after all these years you are finally getting retired from work - FREEDOM! But for your wife? She will have no difference in her work. In fact, she'll have greater work to do just cos you are at home! So make yourself available for simple, small things at home. IT IS NOT FEMININE TO WORK AT HOME! Unfortunately many Indians consider household chores as work for the females. It is not so! Moreover, it is one way of avoiding boredom.\n\n5. Something for yourself - Start feeling happy! You are going to enter second childhood! A time when you can do anything with no one to question you! I assume most of your responsibilities of life would be over by now or will soon be over. So you'll be a free bird - free to do anything you want! So start getting involved in all your old forgotten hobbies - singing, stamp collecting, reading, writing, etc etc! You may also plan to start visiting places. Try to travel around - pilgrimages or simply fun trips! And if your financial position allows it, do go abroad somewhere (like singapore) with your wife.\n\nYou've worked hard the whole of your life for others; spend the last part for yourself.

If, on the other hand, you are a web administrator, then you are talking more long term commitment. The only way I would suggest holding onto the hosting fees if you lease a presence on the web and sub-divide that presence among your clients.

10221,"If you're going to feel guilty, put that feeling into action. This is anecdotal evidence, but I have seen what a terrible effect Wal-Mart has had on the small Texas town where I grew up in the 70s. Most of the family-owned retail shops have closed; downtown is in ruins - there's no good excuse for kids to hang out there the way they used to. Money that used to be reinvested in the community gets paid to a corporate conglomerate with draconian labor practices and wages that are so low that the U.S. taxpayer has subsidizes Wal-Mart employees who don't get benefits packages.\n\nThe place is sterile, the employees cultish. There's no specialized knowledge built up in individual departments. When there was a record shop on Hiram Street, the man who ran it and the kids who worked for him knew about music. The tire store salesman knew about tires. No one at Wal-Mart has that kind of institutional expertise. They're all about being low-priced and friendly, but they're completely removed from the products that they sell. And it's all sanitized, scripted, and carefully censored so that nobody gets his/her sensibilities challenged. \n\nWorst of all, I think Wal-Mart has played a pivotal role in making people believe that they need things they don't need, and want things they don't have any use for. The whole store is a tease, a come-on without a pay-off. (In this respect, Wal-Mart is no different from other players in modern consumer culture; except that Wal-Mart has found a way to destabilize and manipulate people who really don't have very much into wanting more and having even less. It's like a casino in that respect.)\n\nWhere are all the Wal-Schools and Wal-Computers and Wal-Vaccination programs? The Wal-Institute for Public Health? It may be my ignorance in play here, but the Walton family has been fabulously wealthy for a very long time, but they don't seem to have developed a public conscience. They hide behind the good-old-boy image of their late founder. But it's time they started giving back. They've helped destroy a landscape in my hometown that's irreplaceable."

10230,"Two years ago, I had a part-time job instructing at a college in New York.  There were a few Muslim students from the Middle East and Asia studying there.  None of them said they had been harassed by US immigration when they came from the Middle East; their documents were checked very thoroughly, but they were let into the US without any problem.\nUnfortunately, the media in the Muslim countries are very similar to those in the West, in that they can mis-report stories and make every little incident into a huge issue.  Personally, I don't trust much of what the media report from any country overseas.  I take into account the experiences that I have had working with people from foreign countries.  I know from experience that most Muslims are kind, gracious people.  And I hope that Muslims will learn that most of us in the West are the same.\nIt seems to me that the biggest problem Saudi students face when they come to the US to study is that they are placed into a culture that is VERY different from the one in which they were raised.  They do not have to become Westernized, but they do need to understand and accept the differences.\nPeople of good will , no matter what their culture, can usually work out differences peacefully if they try hard enough."

10260,"No, you do not need to be certified. From my experience in starting my consulting firm, everyone claims to be an expert, but they don't know what they are talking about. In about 6 months, you will know more than all of the books put together. So don't sweat it. It just is not that important.\n\nNo, you do not need a business plan. Whoever told you that you needed one is wrong. Business plans are primarily used to get financing from a bank, which you are not going to get for a service business. Since this is only going to be a micro busniess venture, you will spend more time updating your spreadsheets than using the plan. Since you plan on transitioning from a full-time job to this, you are set financially. Don't let this bogus requirement get you down.\n\nYou do need a marketing plan. For your business, I would strongly recommend Guerilla Marketing by Jay Conrad Levinson. Pick a few marketing techniques that you are comfortable with and go at it. Just off the top of my head, I would have business cards, web site, stationery, flyers, and attend networking events. Your potential clients should include salesman (notoriously disorganized), real estate agents, insurance agents, independent consultants, and executives who want an assistant but their company won't let them hire one directly. You want to be marketing regularly. Again, GM by Levinson is perfect for you.\n\nIf I was looking for a virtual assistant, I would only be interested in references and a client list. Having stated that, your first priority should be to define what exactly you are willing to do? Payroll, travel arrangements, online research, telemarketing, etc.  Once you have an idea of what you will do, I would make up a cost sheet and a list of references. Since you do not have any clients, use personal references. The only other question I have that your clients would share is how well are you going to help me when you have a full-time job.\n\nAlthough I do not use VA's, I know small business owners that swear by them. I also know that there were times when I was stuck in an airport that I would have loved having someone to call  who could get me the hell out of there or arrange a hotel or something.  \n\nBest of luck to you."

Then get together and compare, here you can eliminate or even add to a single list you agree on. Then place them in order of importance, please no arguing - if it is important to you (or him) then it is - no matter what you (or he) thinks. Now we have a list, next place a time next to them. House - 3 years, vacation - 1 year etc. Then put dollar amounts next to them - house deposit needed $10,000 divide that by 36 (3 years x 12) you now have a monthly value. Once you have done this you will see that you have monthly values for the things you are trying to do. Then add up everything and get a monthly total. You'll either have enough to do it all or not enough to do it all. Then sit down again and work out what you can eliminate or reduce - 'stuff' once every two months is cheaper than 'stuff' every week. House deposit in 4 years instead of three etc - Once you can see what you can achieve, and you are both on board, then it is easy to do. This may take a few talks, so get coffee and cookies and sit in a nice and comfortable room.\n\nAt some point you may want to show him what you do to pay the bills etc. Alternatively you can have a lot of the bills paid automatically (I do not like this) where you give the utility company your credit card (or checking account)# and they deduct it automatically, every month.

10314,"Your credit rating is a measurment of how safe of an investment you are. If you have a high Credit rating you are considered safe. If you have severall loans you are not necessarily considered to be an unsafe lendee. However if you miss payments or some of your loans are credit card based and near or at the credit limit you would be considered risky.\nMoney is money, and you would want to borrow money at the lowest interst rate possible. You need to look into the current interest rate you are paying and compare it to the consolidation interest rate.\nWhen a person applies for a lot of creidt in a short amount of time their credit rating is affected adversely. Due to this if you are getting this consolidation loan near to another loan you received you could damage your credit rating slightly.\nHowever, paying off high interest loans with the consolidation loan and then making your payments on time would do more good than bad."

10357,"When considering the giants of Canadian politics, T.C. Douglas surely stands at the forefront. Tommy Douglas was a remarkable Canadian whose contributions have helped to shape our great nation. Although he is most famous as the founding father of Medicare, the most advanced health-care system in the world, Douglas’ contributions to Saskatchewan and Canada were tremendous. Douglas established democratic socialism as a mainstream in Canadian politics and his CCF government became the first socialist government in North America. A visionary who achieved his dreams, Douglas changed the face of Canadian politics. More importantly, Tommy Douglas was a politician who put the good of the people he represented first and foremost.\n\nTommy Clement Douglas was born on October 20, 1904 in Falkirk, Scotland. In 1911, Tommy, his mother and his sister moved to Winnipeg to join his father who had moved there the previous year. Shortly after settling in Winnipeg, Tommy was diagnosed with osteomyelitis in his right leg. Tommy’s family was not wealthy and subsequently his family could not pay for the best or most immediate treatment. The delay nearly cost Tommy his leg. This experience marked the beginning of Tommy’s quest for universal, public health care. By the time he was 18, Tommy set his sights on a career as a preacher.\n\nIn 1924, when Tommy reached 20 years of age, he enrolled at Brandon College in Manitoba. Brandon College, which was founded by the missionary Baptists of Ontario, provided young ministers with the opportunity to receive an educational background. In college, Tommy was active in elocution classes, drama, and debating. His peers accepted Douglas as a natural leader and scholar. During weekends and summer months, Tommy would speak at rural churches. At one such trip Tommy met Irma Dempsey, his future wife. By the time he had left Brandon College, Tommy had earned his Bachelor’s degree in the Faculty of Arts.\n\nIn the fall of 1929, Tommy became a minister at Calvary Baptist church in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. The town immediately opened its arms to the young preacher who possessed boundless energy and eloquence. His time in Weyburn allowed Douglas a first hand perspective of the harshness of the Depression in the prairies. Douglas knew that something had to be done for the common man. His experience with the vast unemployment and poverty transformed T.C. Douglas, the clergyman, into a social activist.\n\nBy 1932, Douglas helped organize an Independent Labour Party in Weyburn of which he became president. Saskatchewan’s Independent Labour movement was not large in numbers but they began raising awareness for socialist politics. The movement soon evolved into the Farmer Labour Party. The Farmer Labour Party offered hospital care for everyone on an equal basis, including unemployment insurance and universal pension. By July of 1932, the labour parties of the four western provinces formed an alliance under the name Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. The CCF became Canada’s first national socialist party. The Farmer Labour Party now had something it desperately lacked, the backing of a national movement. In 1934, Douglas made his first foray in the Saskatchewan provincial election. Although he lost, this sparked an internal flame which could not be extinguished.\n\nIn 1935, Douglas was elected into parliament under the CCF. This was a time of great turmoil for Canadian politics. Nearly all the provincial governments had been tossed out of office as Canadians turned to anyone who promised to lead them out of the troubled times. Along with Douglas, there were only four other members of the CCF caucus. At the tender age of 31, the young Douglas impressed the House of Commons with his fiery, yet relevant, speeches. The CCF, with only five seats, did not have much political clout, but that did not stop Douglas from fighting for legislation to support the western provinces. By the end of the 193 Os, the Depression and Worl"
10358,"A lease or tenancy is an interest in personal property or real property given by a lessor to another person (usually called the lessee or tenant) for a fixed period of time, and the lessee obtains exclusive possession of the property in return for paying the lessor a fixed or determinable consideration.\n\nIn law, there are two types of property:\n\nReal property is land or any permanent feature or structure above or below the surface. Ownership of land is an aspect of the system of real property or realty in common law systems (immovables in civil law systems and Conflict of Laws). \nAll other property is considered personal property or personalty in common law systems (movables in civil law and Conflict of Laws), and this property is either tangible or intangible, i.e. it is either physical property that can be touched like a computer, or it is an enforceable right like a patent or other form of intellectual property. \nThere are three separate levels of rights or interests affecting both forms of property. In descending order of importance they are:\n\nownership, \npossession or \ncontrol and use. \nThe legal documents that transfer these rights are respectively: conveyance/transfer, lease/tenancy, and bailment/pledge for tangible personalty, assignments and licenses for intangibles."

It tells the story of a teenaged boy who discovers that his family is part of a witness protection program and that his parents have been keeping secrets from him all his life. As he tries to determine who and what he is, he is threatened and finally overcome by the terrifying forces of a government that is more interested in preserving its own power than in protecting one small boy. The idea for the book grew out of Cormier's reading a magazine article about the then-new federal witness protection program and his fascination with the idea of individuals struggling against an unjust society.

The term can be applied to any sport and any nationality of player. The term dates from the practice in the United Kingdom of awarding a cap (meaning an item of headgear) to every player in an international match. The practice was first approved on May 10, 1886 for Association Football, after a proposal made by N. L. Jackson, an Old Corinthian:\n\n""That all players taking part for England in future international matches be presented with a white silk cap with red rose embroidered on the front. These to be termed International Caps.""\n\nActual caps are not usually given anymore (caps for friendly matches still exist, and each player gets one cap per international competition), but the term ""cap"" for an international appearance has been retained. Thus, a ""cap"" is awarded for each game played and so a player who has played x games, for the team, is said to have been capped x times or have won x caps."

When you are about to repair your credit history, or do battle with collection agencies, knowledge of the law is your only weapon!  DO NOT fight these jerks unarmed!!!  Read the links I supplied below.\n\nAs I understand it, you got this credit card before you got married?  That's good, because they can't go after your husbands income.\n\nThe very first thing you need to do is write a letter to the collection agencies that are bothering you.  Use the sample letters in the links below.  By law, if you tell them to stop bothering you, they must stop all contact.  But be warned, you are basically telling them to either sue you or back off.  \n\nIf your debt isn't that big they will most likely leave you alone.  The credit report will remain on your records for 7 years from the time you defaulted on the last payment.  There are ways to get it removed from the records, or at least limit the impact.\n\nThey can sue you if the debt is not that old.  The ""Statute of Limitations"" varies from state to state.  Most are 6 years.  After that the can't sue you, but they can still mess up your credit history.\n\nYou are in a better situation because your debts are before you got married.  Live off your husbands credit for now.  \n\nWhen I got married, my wife came with a lot of debt baggage.  They were after her for trailer payments, and loans made with her past marriage.  She was getting 2-3 credit letters a month and was a nervous wreck.  The jerks even found my phone number and began calling us up.\n\nBut what they didn't know was.....\nI WAS ARMED!  I knew the law.  I knew how to handle these jerks!\n\nThe calls and letters stopped.  I cleaned up her credit history and now she has a credit card of her own and a good rating.  \n\nI'm not a credit counsoler, got no legal experience.  I just know where to look for information. Now you do too!\n\nWrite me if you need encouragement.  Your situation isn't bad at all."

I personally do not want Vaidisova or Clijsters to win. I think Vaidisova is dooping. Too bad, the officials will find out after the tornament is over. And, i don't want Clijsters to win because she is retiring anyways by the end of the year. So i don't think she should retire as the dominant female player in tennis. I want to see Kuznetsova and Hardenne in the final. By the way, did you know that Kuznetsova and Hardenne met in the 4th round of last year's French Open? Kuznetsova had like 2 match points, but Hardenne managed to overcome them and ended up winning the match, along with the other matches. Kuznetsova was the only player that chellenged her, the rest could not even take a set off her.

It's simply a legally protected word or phrase, used to ""protect"" that word or phrase. Typically protection only applies within a specific business category (e.g. beverages) and within a specific country. The protection prevents others in the industry from using the same phrase. Examples of things that may bear a trademark are brand names, taglines (""The choice of a new generation""), or the names of sub-brands or specific services: ""McGriddle"". It's also possible to trademark sounds (the ABC tones, the sound of a Harley Davidson engine) and logos (but sometimes with limited success - Harley Davidson was not successful. - the sound was deemed too generic and therefore ""not ownable"".)\n\nDon't confuse TM with Copyright - A copyright is obtained by registering an entire text, song, or other full proprietary creation like a book, article, lyrics, etc."

Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep the peace...even if it means preparing for war.\n2) Even though the US is the only country to have ever USED a nuclear weapon, we didn't do it just because we didn't like the Japanese.  We could have dropped a nuke on Russia during the Cold War if that were true.\n3) The US doesn't go around threatening other countries because they ""don't have a right to exist.""  We also aren't known for strapping bombs to our children and sending them to the mall.\n4) We would ONLY ever use a nuke again if it was a deterrent, or if someone nuked us first.  Most countries wouldn't be stupid enough to do this, because we could bomb them right off the face of the Earth.\n5) The countries that we are trying to stop from pursuing nuclear technology would USE a bomb.  As I said, we wouldn't, and haven't, except sixty years ago when our government felt we had no choice."
